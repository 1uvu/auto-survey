      <td>Blockchain for the Internet of Things: A systematic literature review</td>
      <td>In the Internet of Things (IoT) scenario, the block-chain and, in general, Peer-to-Peer approaches could play an important role in the development of decentralized and data-intensive applications running on billion of devices, preserving the privacy of the users. Our research goal is to understand whether the blockchain and Peer-to-Peer approaches can be employed to foster a decentralized and private-by-design IoT. As a first step in our research process, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review on the blockchain to gather knowledge on the current uses of this technology and to document its current degree of integrity, anonymity and adaptability. We found 18 use cases of blockchain in the literature. Four of these use cases are explicitly designed for IoT. We also found some use cases that are designed for a private-by-design data management. We also found several issues in the integrity, anonymity and adaptability. Regarding anonymity, we found that in the blockchain only pseudonymity is guaranteed. Regarding adaptability and integrity, we discovered that the integrity of the blockchain largely depends on the high difficulty of the Proof-of-Work and on the large number of honest miners, but at the same time a difficult Proof-of-Work limits the adaptability. We documented and categorized the current uses of the blockchain, and provided a few recommendations for future work to address the above-mentioned issues.</td>

      <td>Blockchain application and outlook in the banking industry</td>
      <td>Blockchain technology is a core, underlying technology with promising application prospects in the banking industry. On one hand, the banking industry in China is facing the impact of interest rate liberalization and profit decline caused by the narrowing interest-rate spread. On the other hand, it is also affected by economic transformation, Internet development, and financial innovations. Hence, the banking industry requires urgent transformation and is seeking new growth avenues. As such, blockchains could revolutionize the underlying technology of the payment clearing and credit information systems in banks, thus upgrading and transforming them. Blockchain applications also promote the formation of “multi-center, weakly intermediated” scenarios, which will enhance the efficiency of the banking industry. However, despite the permissionless and self-governing nature of blockchains, the regulation and actual implementation of a decentralized system are problems that remain to be resolved. Therefore, we propose the urgent establishment of a “regulatory sandbox” and the development of industry standards.</td>

      <td>Equity crowdfunding via the Internet is a new channel of raising money for startups. It features low barriers to entry, low cost, and high speed, and thus encourages innovation. In recent years, equity crowdfunding in China has experienced some developments. However, some problems remain unsolved in practice. Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger technology to ensure data security, transparency, and integrity. Because it cannot be tampered with or forged, the technology is deemed to have great potential in the finance industry. This study examines current problems in the practice of equity crowdfunding in China. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of blockchain technology, this study further explores its practical applications in equity crowdfunding. 1) Blockchain technology may be a secure, efficient, low-cost solution for the registration of stocks and shares of a firm financed by crowdfunding; 2) Blockchain technology simplifies the transaction and transfer of crowdfunding equities, and thus facilitates their circulation; 3) Blockchain technology enables peer to peer transactions between investors and entrepreneurs, and solves the problems of regulatory compliance and security of fund management; Blockchain technology can be used to develop a voting system for crowdfunders, which enables them to be involved in corporate governance. This helps protect the rights and interests of small investors; 5) Blockchain technology helps regulators know about market conditions, and supports regulatory activities such as managing investors and fighting money laundering.</td>

Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) is considered to be a global consensus protocol and promises to be Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) by bringing with it the concept of quorum slices and federated byzantine fault tolerance. This consensus's working and its comparison with other protocols that were earlier proposed are analyzed here. Also, hyperledger an open-source project by Linux Foundation which includes implementing the concept of practical byzantine fault tolerance and also a platform where various other consensus protocols and blockchain applications can be deployed in a plug and play manner is also being discussed here. This paper focuses on analyzing these consensus protocols already proposed and their feasibility and efficiency in meeting the characteristics they propose to provide.</td>

A new technology, Blockchain, may be a key to addressing these challenges and should draw the attention of the whole clinical research community.Blockchain brings the Internet to its definitive decentralisation goal. The core principle of Blockchain is that any service relying on trusted third parties can be built in a transparent, decentralised, secure “trustless” manner at the top of the Blockchain (in fact, there is trust, but it is hardcoded in the Blockchain protocol via a complex cryptographic algorithm). Therefore, users have a high degree of control over and autonomy and trust of the data and its integrity. Blockchain allows for reaching a substantial level of historicity and inviolability of data for the whole document flow in a clinical trial. Hence, it ensures traceability, prevents a posteriori reconstruction and allows for securely automating the clinical trial through what are called Smart Contracts. At the same time, the technology ensures fine-grained control of the data, its security and its shareable parameters, for a single patient or group of patients or clinical trial stakeholders.In this commentary article, we explore the core functionalities of Blockchain applied to clinical trials and we illustrate concretely its general principle in the context of consent to a trial protocol. Trying to figure out the potential impact of Blockchain implementations in the setting of clinical trials will shed new light on how modern clinical trial methods could evolve and benefit from Blockchain technologies in order to tackle the aforementioned challenges.</td>

      <td>Blockchain – A Disruptive Technology</td>
      <td>Blockchain technology and distributed ledgers are attracting massive attention and trigger multiple projects in different industries. However, the financial industry is seen as a primary user of the blockchain concept. This is not only due to the fact that the most well-known application of this technology is the crypto-currency Bitcoin, but it is also driven by substantial process inefficiencies and a massive cost base issue specifically in this industry. On top of this, the financial crisis revealed that even in financial services it is not always possible to identify the correct present owner of an asset. It is even more of a problem to retrace ownership over a longer chain of changing buyers in global financial transaction services: when, e.g., the US investment bank Bear Stearns failed in 2008 and was completely acquired by JP Morgan Chase, the number of shares offered to the acquirer was larger than the shares outstanding in the books of Bear Stearns. It was not possible to clarify the accounting errors and JP Morgan Chase had to bear the damage from excess (digital) shares.\n\nWhile the problem of tracing back ownership in long transaction chains is already a critical aspect in financial markets, it is also important for physical goods, e.g., (blood) diamonds or broccoli. US retailer Wal-Mart with more than 260 million customers per week is in search for a technology that helps to identify precisely those batches of vegetables that in a given case, e.g., are infected by coliform bacteria.\n\nIntermediation is today’s dominating solution for verifying ownership of assets and transaction processing. Intermediaries perform the careful checking of each involved party along a chain of intermediaries. However, this is not only time consuming and costly but also bears a credit risk in case an intermediary fails. The blockchain technology promises to overcome these critical aspects, representing “a shift from trusting people to trusting math” (Antonopoulos 2014) since human interventions are no longer necessary.</td>

We begin our discussion with EOS, an Ethereum competitor built with an OS inspired architecture and platform-support design philosophy. It uses a new consensus mechanism called delegated proof-of-stake to enable rapid transaction verification and a continuous cycle of voting for delegates that support the network. The message passing protocols implemented in EOS are very advanced, allowing automated response handlers and action triggers on message delivery. They make up most of the smart contract system. There is also support for parallel lockless execution of smart contract instructions across the network, massively reducing latency in communication and state updates.</td>

      <td>Understanding the Blockchain Using Enterprise Ontology</td>
      <td>Blockchain technology is regarded as highly disruptive, but there is a lack of formalization and standardization of terminology. Not only because there are several (sometimes propriety) implementation platforms, but also because the academic literature so far is predominantly written from either a purely technical or an economic application perspective. The result of the confusion is an offspring of blockchain solutions, types, roadmaps and interpretations. For blockchain to be accepted as a technology standard in established industries, it is pivotal that ordinary internet users and business executives have a basic yet fundamental understanding of the workings and impact of blockchain. This conceptual paper provides a theoretical contribution and guidance on what blockchain actually is by taking an ontological approach. Enterprise Ontology is used to make a clear distinction between the datalogical, infological and essential level of blockchain transactions and smart contracts.</td>

      <td>This paper discusses the life cycle of decentralized smart contracts, i.e. digital and executable representations of rights and obligations in a multi-party environment. The life cycle relies on blockchain technology, i.e. a distributed digital ledger, to ensure proper implementation and integrity of the smart contracts. The life cycle consists of four subsequent phases: Creation, freezing, execution, and finalization. For each phase actors and technological services are identified and explained in detail. With the life cycle at hand, risks and limitations of smart contracts and the underlying blockchain technology are briefly discussed.</td>

      <td>Foundations of Blockchain</td>
      <td>The blockchain is a decentralized data structure with internal consistency maintained through consensus reached by all the users on the current state of the network. It’s an enabling technology that resolved the Byzantine generals’ problem (message communication between untrusted parties) and opened up a new horizon of possibilities for trustless transactions and exchange of information. If the Internet democratized the peer-to-peer exchange of information, then the blockchain has democratized the peer-to-peer exchange of value. We begin this chapter by exploring how transactions work between users on the Bitcoin network. This entails a technical discussion of structures of a block and a transaction. We then dive into the role of wallets and user addresses. After talking about wallets, we shift our focus to simple payment verification (SPV) implemented in the Bitcoin network. SPV allows us to understand why blocks have a peculiar structure and more important, how the Bitcoin network can retain efficiency despite the network scaling at a high rate. Finally, we conclude our discussion by talking about hard and soft forks in the blockchain. We present the implications of forks in the context of forward compatibility for merchants and users involved in running the Bitcoin-core code.</td>

      <td>Formal Modeling and Verification of Smart Contracts</td>
      <td>Smart contracts can automatically perform the contract terms according to the received information, and it is one of the most important research fields in digital society. The core of smart contracts is algorithm contract, that is, the parties reach an agreement on the contents of the contract and perform the contracts according to the behaviors written in certain computer algorithms. It not only needs to make sure about the correctness of smart contracts code, but also should provide a credible contract code execution environment. Blockchain provides a trusted execution and storage environment for smart contracts by the distributed secure storage, consistency verification and encryption technology. Current challenge is how to assure that smart contract can be executed as the parties' willingness. This paper introduces formal modeling and verification in formal methods to make smart contract model and verify the properties of smart contracts. Formal methods combined with smart contracts aim to reduce the potential errors and cost during contract development process. The description of a general and formal smart contract template is provided. The tool of model checking, SPIN, is used to verify the correctness and necessary properties for a smart contract template. The research shows model checking will be useful and necessary for smart contracts.</td>

Although the Github\ncurrently hosts more than six thousand active Blockchain software (BCS)\nprojects, few software engineering research has investigated these projects and\nits' contributors. Although the number of BCS projects is growing rapidly, the\nmotivations, challenges, and needs of BCS developers remain a puzzle.\nTherefore, the primary objective of this study is to understand the\nmotivations, challenges, and needs of BCS developers and analyze the\ndifferences between BCS and non-BCS development. On this goal, we sent an\nonline survey to 1,604 active BCS developers identified via mining the Github\nrepositories of 145 popular BCS projects. The survey received 156 responses\nthat met our criteria for analysis.\nThe results suggest that the majority of the BCS developers are experienced\nin non-BCS development and are primarily motivated by the ideology of creating\na decentralized financial system. Although most of the BCS projects are Open\nSource Software (OSS) projects by nature, more than 93% of our respondents\nfound BCS development somewhat different from a non-BCS development as BCS\nprojects have higher emphasis on security and reliability than most of the\nnon-BCS projects. Other differences include: higher costs of defects,\ndecentralized and hostile environment, technological complexity, and difficulty\nin upgrading the software after release. Software development tools that are\ntuned for non-BCS development are inadequate for BCS and the ecosystem needs an\narray of new or improved tools, such as: customized IDE for BCS development\ntasks, debuggers for smart-contracts, testing support, easily deployable\nsimulators, and BCS domain specific design notations.\n\n</td>

The blockchain network was originated from the Internet financial\nsector as a decentralized, immutable ledger system for transactional data\nordering. Nowadays, it is envisioned as a powerful backbone/framework for\ndecentralized data processing and data-driven self-organization in flat,\nopen-access networks. In particular, the plausible characteristics of\ndecentralization, immutability and self-organization are primarily owing to the\nunique decentralized consensus mechanisms introduced by blockchain networks.\nThis survey is motivated by the lack of a comprehensive literature review on\nthe development of decentralized consensus mechanisms in blockchain networks.\nIn this survey, we provide a systematic vision of the organization of\nblockchain networks. By emphasizing the unique characteristics of incentivized\nconsensus in blockchain networks, our in-depth review of the state-of-the-art\nconsensus protocols is focused on both the perspective of distributed consensus\nsystem design and the perspective of incentive mechanism design. From a\ngame-theoretic point of view, we also provide a thorough review on the strategy\nadoption for self-organization by the individual nodes in the blockchain\nbackbone networks. Consequently, we provide a comprehensive survey on the\nemerging applications of the blockchain networks in a wide range of areas.

      <td>Smart Contract Programming Languages on Blockchains: An Empirical Evaluation of Usability and Security</td>
      <td>\nBlockchain is a promising infrastructural technology that is finding its way into a growing number of domains like big data, finance, and medical. While blockchain has come to be thought of primarily as the foundation for Bitcoin, it has evolved far beyond underpinning the virtual currency. As it becomes progressively popular, the need for effective programming means would be more demanding. Blockchain programming as a core means provides accounts of the ‘code is law’ that specifies agreements between parties and allows its stakeholders to still trust the platform to execute the agreed-upon contract (known as smart contract) as expected. Although it seems straightforward in theory, it is hardly the case when it comes to real-life situations. There have been several instances that show smart contracts are riddled with issues and vulnerabilities in code, causing damages. What’s for sure is lacking is that the existing languages are not living up to the point to be able to unleash the full potential of the blockchain, as often have resulted in buggy code with a steep learning curve for developers. This denotes that the current research on contract development is not sufficient and is still in a stage of infancy. In order to advance the state of the research in this area, an evaluation of the current state-of-the-art practices in a thorough and experimental manner is required. Thus, the objective of this paper is to give a comprehensive analysis of such domain-specific programming practices from critical points of usability and security to provide a working guideline for newcomers and researchers.</td>

      <td>Ride-hailing service is gaining an increasing popularity due to its great advantages on fare estimation, automatic payments, and reputation ratings. However, how to build the trust between the driver and the passenger and achieve the secure billing still remains an open challenge. This paper proposes a novel secure billing protocol which removes the presence of the online third party by a smart contract on a publicly-verifiable two-party blockchain. In the proposed secure billing protocol, the driver and the passenger generate a blockchain which contains information about the ride. The driver and the passenger measure their own trajectories respectively in rounds. At the end of each round, they exchange their trajectories of the current round. If the difference of trajectories is within a threshold, they jointly compute the fare of current round. After completing the computation, the passenger pays the driver the fare of the current round via a micropayment channel. The driver and the passenger end each round by adding the information generated in this round into the blockchain. The blockchain can be considered as an evidence of the ride since it contains all the information of the ride. We evaluate the performance and the effectiveness of the proposed protocol via extensive experiments and detailed analysis.</td>

Method: We sent an online survey to 1,604 active BCS developers identified via mining the Github repositories of 145 popular BCS projects. The survey received 156 responses that met our criteria for analysis. Results: We found that code review and unit testing are the two most effective software development practices among BCS developers. The results suggest that the requirements of BCS projects are mostly identified and selected by community discussion and project owners which is different from requirement collection of general OSS projects. The results also reveal that the development tasks in BCS projects are primarily assigned on voluntary basis, which is the usual task assignment practice for OSS projects. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that standard software engineering methods including testing and security best practices need to be adapted with more seriousness to address unique characteristics of blockchain and mitigate potential threats.</td>

      <td>The ability of blockchain technology to record transactions on distributed ledgers offers new opportunities for governments to improve transparency, prevent fraud, and establish trust in the public sector. However, blockchain adoption and use in the context of e-Government is rather unexplored in academic literature. In this paper, we systematically review relevant research to understand the current research topics, challenges and future directions regarding blockchain adoption for e-Government. The results show that the adoption of blockchain-based applications in e-Government is still very limited and there is a lack of empirical evidence. The main challenges faced in blockchain adoption are predominantly presented as technological aspects such as security, scalability and flexibility. From an organizational point of view, the issues of acceptability and the need of new governance models are presented as the main barriers to adoption. Moreover, the lack of legal and regulatory support is identified as the main environmental barrier of adoption. Based on the challenges presented in the literature, we propose future research questions that need to be addressed to inform how the public sector should approach the blockchain technology adoption.</td>

This paper summarizes the conditions of blockchain research in terms of technology and its implementation. This paper was written using a systematic literature review (SLR) as one of the methodologies used to solve problems by tracing the results of previous studies. The problem that you want to study in SLR is usually referred to as a research question (RQ). The defined RQ is related to the topic and clarifies each question by tracing previous research papers indexed in reputable journal databases such as IEEE Xplore, Springerlink, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. After synthesizing 41 articles, the result is: blockchain can be used in many applications, some applications that adopt blockchain technology are banking applications, e-voting applications and digital forensic applications. Often, applications that use blockchain technology only focus on developing one of the blockchain technologies that suits their needs. Some developers maximize the components of the contract on the blockchain, some further develop the data structure of the blockchain itself. The use of blockchain technology is still wide open for the implementation of other information systems. The expected contribution of this paper is to provide a general overview for researchers who want to build applications that use blockchain as a basis for researching so they can conduct further studies to better understand whether the applications they will develop are suitable for using blockchain technology as a basis.</td>

However, it is one of the most transparent payment networks since all transactions are publicly announced. Blockchain, which is the public ledger of Bitcoin, includes all transactions to prevent double-spending and to provide integrity. By using data in the blockchain, flow of bitcoins between transactions can be observed and activities of the users can be traced. When the implications obtained from the blockchain are combined with external data, identity and profile of a user can be revealed. This possibility has undesirable effects such as spending history of a user becomes accessible to other people, or cash flow of a merchant becomes exposed to competitors. There are several proposals as extensions or alternatives to Bitcoin, which improve anonymity and privacy.

By means of a dual literature review we find that 1) the conceptualization of trust differs substantially between the contexts of blockchain and the sharing economy, 2) blockchain technology is to some degree suitable to replace trust in platform providers, and that 3) trust-free systems are hardly transferable to sharing economy interactions and will crucially depend on the development of trusted interfaces for blockchain-based sharing economy ecosystems.</td>

      <td>Interconnecting cyber-physical systems in networks leads to the creation of cyber-physical system-of-systems. In a cyber-physical system-of-systems (CPSoS), systems communicate by exchanging and sharing data and information, which this chapter also refers to as interoperability of information. To ensure reliable and secure interoperability of information between distributed cyber-physical systems, using blockchain technology or distributed ledging technology for distributed entities is an interesting option. Such a blockchain must, at a minimum, be fault tolerant and enable the entities involved to reach consensus on the information transactions that are to be performed. Once consensus about transactions between cyber-physicals is reached, it must be possible for these to record consistently the used data in a distributed ledger that provides a permanent shared overview of completed information transactions. The development of the new technology we call blockchain creates a new and as yet unfathomable reality of interconnected autonomous and self-organising cyber-physical systems that have the ability to make decisions about or for us as human beings.</td>

      <td>Blockchain is a disruptive technology with the potential to have a significant impact on business models and industries, similar to the adoption of Internet. Blockchain promotes distributed, open, inclusive, immutable, and secure architectural approaches, instead of centralized, hidden, exclusive, and alterable alternatives. The adoption of blockchain in the healthcare domain offers promising solutions for securing communications among stakeholders, efficient delivery of clinical reports, and integrating various kinds of private health records of individuals on a secure infrastructure. Accordingly, the main aim of this study is to propose a holistic blockchain structure covering all stakeholders in the healthcare domain and to analyse opportunities and challenges by presenting an integrated blockchain architecture. The comprehensive view of blockchain based healthcare system consists of services as follows: personal medical health record storage and access, personal genomic data storage and access, inventory tracking and buy-sell mechanism, health research commons, health document notary services, doctor services, digital health wallet, peer-to peer insurance. The opportunities of using blockchain in the healthcare domain are considered with respect to several viewpoints such as transparency, accountability, decentralization, record accuracy, secure transactions, interoperability, lower costs, collaboration, agility, individualized care with specialized treatment, improved diagnosis methods, risk of insurance contract, prevention of counterfeit drugs and improved quality of medical research. Challenges associated with the implementation of blockchain in the healthcare domain are also highlighted, such as governance, lack of legacy, privacy, sustainability, scalability, adoption of participation, and cost of operations.</td>

This technology is simplifying financial markets—many organizations are launching initial coin offerings to facilitate the financing of new business ventures; moreover, ‘securities’ that are issued in such a digital form can be bought and sold in the secondary market without the intervention of the traditional intermediaries. However, this use of blockchain could give rise to many problems which, in this article, will be analysed from the prospective of insolvency law. This paper will argue: first, that these problems originate from the fact that the issuance of blockchain securities is creating a divide between the world where securities are issued, offered and sold, and the world where law is enforceable; secondly, that these problems cannot be managed easily because of the lack of an apt point of attack, rather than because of the claim that the principle of technological neutrality should be observed; thirdly, that—under certain conditions—the sandbox approach that is being adopted by the UK financial conduct authority could contribute to directly shaping the platforms in pursuit of regulatory goals.</td>

Currently, scientists must be trusted to provide a true and useful representation of their research results in their final publication; blockchain would make much larger parts of the research cycle open to scientific self-correction. This bears the potential to be a new approach to the current reproducibility crisis in science, and could “reduce waste and make more research results true”.

Bitcoin peer-to-peer transactions are independent of the banking system, facilitating foreign exchanges with low transaction fees, such as remittances, and offering a high degree of anonymity. These opportunities together with other key factors led the Bitcoin to become extremely popular and caused its price to skyrocket during 2017 (Henry et al. in J Digit Bank 2(4):311–337, 2018).However, while the Bitcoin blockchain attracts a lot of attention, it remains difficult to investigate where this attention comes from, due to the pseudo-anonymity of the system, and consequently to appreciate its social impact. Here we make an attempt to characterize the adoption of the Bitcoin blockchain by country. In the first part of the work we show that information about the number of Bitcoin software client downloads, the IP addresses that act as relays for the transactions, and the Internet searches about Bitcoin provide together a coherent picture of the system evolution in different countries. Using these quantities as a proxy for user adoption, we identify several socio-economic indexes such as the GDP per capita, freedom of trade and the Internet penetration as key variables correlated with the degree of user adoption.In the second part of the work, we build a network of Bitcoin transactions between countries using the IP addresses of nodes relaying transactions and we develop an augmented version of the gravity model of trade in order to identify socio-economic factors linked to the flow of Bitcoin between countries. In a nutshell our study provides a new insight on Bitcoin adoption by country and on the potential socio-economic drivers of the international Bitcoin flow.</td>

Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the blockchain technology enables the decentralized consensus recording of success of debt repayment or debt default rendered by verifying and validating certain lending and borrowing activities in distributed ledgers. In the newly proposed blockchain embedded credit system, SMEs with low-risk and high-quality could display their credibility and risk class through information distribution. They are more likely to access bank loans even if they are not able to provide collateral. Results derived from the theoretical model present two main findings. First, the alleviation of information asymmetry and credit rationing problems can be achieved through decentralized consensus and information distribution among all participants. Second, the risk sharing mechanism involving government, banks and firms, will not only make the establishment of such an innovative system possible, but also create risk pool for the blockchain based lending and borrowing.</td>

      <td>\nInternet of Things (IoT) is a network that connects lots of smart devices around the world. As a revolutionary technology, it has been developing rapidly in recent years. This paper summarizes the obstacles of IoT in terms of security and efficient operation network and introduces the Blockchain to solve these problems. Nowadays, many IoT application use the traditional central structure and collect all data in one center node. However, with connected devices on the rise, it is required that the center node should have a huge computing power, storage space and bandwidth, thus making the operation cost become higher. For IoT, another focus is all about private and security. All transaction data are stored in the third party, which means hackers can break security barriers and steal user information easily. Moreover, some businessmen will sell user information to other parties without owner’s authorization. Through this paper we find that Blockchain can provide a distributed, transparent platform with trustless mechanism and collective maintenance of security for the IoT. But, applying Blockchain directly to IoT may result in many problems, such as limited resource, longer delays, poor scalability. At present, there is not a Blockchain model which can be applied in large scale IoT networks. The future study can be followed along this line.</td>

      <td>Blockchain Economic Networks: Economic Network Theory—Systemic Risk and Blockchain Technology</td>
      <td>This chapter discusses how the widespread adoption of blockchain technology (distributed ledgers) might contribute to solving a larger class of economic problems related to systemic risk, specifically the degree of systemic risk in financial networks (ongoing credit relationships between parties). The chapter introduces economic network theory, drawing from König and Battiston (2009). Then, Part I develops payment network analysis (analyzing immediate cash transfers) in the classical payment network setting (Fedwire (Soramäki 2007)) synthesized with the cryptocurrency environment (Bitcoin (Maesa 2017), Monero (Miller 2017), and Ripple (Moreno-Sanchez et al. 2018)). The key finding is that the replication of network statistical behavior in cryptographic networks indicates the robust (not merely anecdotal) adoption of blockchain systems. Part II addresses balance sheet network analysis (ongoing obligations over time), first from the classical sense of central bank balance sheet network analysis developed by Castrén (2009, 2013), Gai and Kapadia (2010), and Chan-Lau (2010), and then proposes how blockchain economic networks might help solve systemic risk problems. The chapter concludes with the potential economic and social benefits of blockchain economic networks, particularly as a new technological affordance is created, algorithmic trust, to support financial systems.</td>

      <td>A PubMed query run in June 2018 using the keyword ‘blockchain’ retrieved 40 indexed papers, a reflection of the growing interest in blockchain among the medical and healthcare research and practice communities. Blockchain’s foundations of decentralisation, cryptographic security and immutability make it a strong contender in reshaping the healthcare landscape worldwide. Blockchain solutions are currently being explored for: (1) securing patient and provider identities; (2) managing pharmaceutical and medical device supply chains; (3) clinical research and data monetisation; (4) medical fraud detection; (5) public health surveillance; (6) enabling truly public and open geo-tagged data; (7) powering many Internet of Things-connected autonomous devices, wearables, drones and vehicles, via the distributed peer-to-peer apps they run, to deliver the full vision of smart healthy cities and regions; and (8) blockchain-enabled augmented reality in crisis mapping and recovery scenarios, including mechanisms for validating, crediting and rewarding crowdsourced geo-tagged data, among other emerging use cases. Geospatially-enabled blockchain solutions exist today that use a crypto-spatial coordinate system to add an immutable spatial context that regular blockchains lack. These geospatial blockchains do not just record an entry’s specific time, but also require and validate its associated proof of location, allowing accurate spatiotemporal mapping of physical world events. Blockchain and distributed ledger technology face similar challenges as any other technology threatening to disintermediate legacy processes and commercial interests, namely the challenges of blockchain interoperability, security and privacy, as well as the need to find suitable and sustainable business models of implementation. Nevertheless, we expect blockchain technologies to get increasingly powerful and robust, as they become coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) in various real-word healthcare solutions involving AI-mediated data exchange on blockchains.</td>

      <td>Blockchain technology is a decentralized database that stores a registry of assets and transactions across a peer-to-peer computer network, which is secured through cryptography, and over time, its history gets locked in blocks of data that are cryptographically linked together and secured. So far, there have been use cases of this technology for cryptocurrencies, digital contracts, financial and public records, and property ownership. It is expected that future uses will expand into medicine, science, education, intellectual property, and supply chain management. Likely applications in the field of medicine could include electronic health records, health insurance, biomedical research, drug supply and procurement processes, and medical education. Utilization of blockchain is not without its weaknesses and currently, this technology is extremely immature and lacks public or even expert knowledge, making it hard to have a clear strategic vision of its true future potential. Presently, there are issues with scalability, security of smart contracts, and user adoption. Nevertheless, with capital investments into blockchain technology projected to reach US$400 million in 2019, health professionals and decision makers should be aware of the transformative potential that blockchain technology offers for healthcare organizations and medical practice.</td>

      <td>Blockchain has many benefits including decentralization, availability, persistency, consistency, anonymity, auditability and accountability, and it also covers a wide spectrum of applications ranging from cryptocurrency, financial services, reputation system, Internet of Things, sharing economy to public and social services. Not only may blockchain be regarded as a by-product of Bitcoin cryptocurrency systems, but also it is a type of distributed ledger technologies through using a trustworthy, decentralized log of totally ordered transactions. By summarizing the literature of blockchain, it is found that more and more important research is to develop basic theory, for example, mathematical models (Markov processes, queueing theory and game models) for mining management and consensus mechanism, performance analysis and optimization of blockchain systems. In this paper, we develop queueing theory of blockchain systems and provide system performance evaluation. To do this, we design a Markovian batch-service queueing system with two different service stages, which are suitable to well express the mining process in the miners pool and the building of a new blockchain. By using the matrix-geometric solution, we obtain a system stable condition and express three key performance measures: (a) The average number of transactions in the queue, (b) the average number of transactions in a block, and (c) the average transaction-confirmation time. Finally, we use numerical examples to verify computability of our theoretical results. Although our queueing model here is simple only under exponential or Poisson assumptions, our analytic method will open a series of potentially promising research in queueing theory of blockchain systems.</td>

      <td>Integrating Digital Identity and Blockchain</td>
      <td>Blockchain is a recent technology whose importance is rapidly growing. One of its native features is pseudo-anonymity, since users are referred by (blockchain) addresses, which are hashed public keys with no link to real identities. However, when moving from the use of blockchain as simple platform for cryptocurrencies to applications in which we want to automatize trust and transparency, in general, there is not the need of anonymity. Indeed, there are situations in which secure accountability, trust and transparency should coexist (e.g., in supply-chain management) to accomplish the goal of the application to design. Blockchain may appear little suitable for these cases, due to its pseudo-anonymity feature, so that an important research problem is to understand how to overcome this drawback. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a solution that mixes the mechanism of public digital identity with blockchain via Identity-Based-Encryption. We define the solution and show its application to a real-life case study.</td>

Existing studies addressing blockchain applications within construction and the built environment have ignored the interrelation of social and technological dimensions. To address this gap, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional emergent framework for DLT adoption within the construction sector. The framework was developed following a focus group discussion and took a socio-technical systems approach that encompasses three dimensions: political, social and technical. The framework was overlaid with an extensive set of construction-related challenges and opportunities and identified a number of associated agents across the dimensions. The structured and inter-connected dimensions provided by the framework can be used by field researchers as a point of departure to investigate a range of research questions from political, social or technical perspectives.</td>

However, being a technology that could decrease significance many of today’s large global corporations, institutions and power structures which have keen interest in preserving established hierarchies, its potential could well remain unexploited.

      <td>There is currently a big rush in the research and practice communities to investigate the blockchain technology towards leveraging its security, immutability and transparency features to create new services or improve existing ones. In developing countries, which are seen as a fertile ground for field testing disruptive technologies, blockchain is viewed as the “trust machine” that is necessary for accelerating development. Unfortunately, the internal working of blockchain as well as its constraints are often overlooked in the design of services. This, in conjunction with a poor regulatory framework, slows down any concrete attempt to build upon the technology. In this paper, we contribute towards accelerating the concrete adoption of blockchain by making explicit the constraints that affect their practical use in the context of developing countries such as African sub-saharan countries. Overall we recommend that the technology should be adjusted to the real-world constraints, in particular those that we currently witness on network latency, computation power as well as cultural gaps.</td>

We further distinguish two major approaches, namely the Identifier Registry Model and its extension the Claim Registry Model.Subsequently we discuss identifiers in such a system, presenting past research in the area and current approaches in SSI in the context of Zooko’s Triangle. As the user of an SSI has to be linked with his digital identifier we also discuss authentication solutions.Most central to the concept of an SSI are the verifiable claims that are presented to relying parties. Resources in the field are only loosely connected. We will provide a more coherent view of verifiable claims in regards to blockchain based SSI and clarify differences in the used terminology.Storage solutions for the verifiable claims, both on- and off-chain, are presented with their advantages and disadvantages.</td>

      <td>\nAbstract:  Since it takes time and effort to put a new product or service on the market,\none would like to predict whether it will be a success. In general this is not\npossible, but it is possible to follow best practices in order to maximise the\nchance of success. A smart contract is intended to encode business logic and is\ntherefore at the heart of every new business on the Ethereum blockchain. We\nhave investigated how to measure the success of smart contracts, and whether\nsuccessful smart contracts have characteristics that less successful smart\ncontracts lack. The appearance of a smart contract on a listing website such as\nEtherscan or StateoftheDapps is such a characteristic. In this paper, we\npresent a three-pronged analysis of the relative success of listed smart\ncontracts. First, we have used statistical analysis on the publicly visible\ntransaction history of the Ethereum blockchain to determine that listed\ncontracts are significantly more successful than their unlisted counterparts.\nNext, we have conducted a survey among more than 200 developers via an\nanonymous online survey about their experience with the listing process. A\nsignificant majority of respondents do not believe that listing a contract\nitself contributes to its success, but they believe that the extra attention\nthat is typically paid in tandem with the listing process does contribute.\nFinally, based on the respondents' answers, we have drafted 10 recommendations\nfor developers and validated them by submitting them to an international panel\nof experts.\n\n</td>

      <td>Security Analysis Methods on Ethereum Smart Contract Vulnerabilities: A Survey</td>
      <td>\nAbstract:  Smart contracts are software programs featuring both traditional applications\nand distributed data storage on blockchains. Ethereum is a prominent blockchain\nplatform with the support of smart contracts. The smart contracts act as\nautonomous agents in critical decentralized applications and hold a significant\namount of cryptocurrency to perform trusted transactions and agreements.\nMillions of dollars as part of the assets held by the smart contracts were\nstolen or frozen through the notorious attacks just between 2016 and 2018, such\nas the DAO attack, Parity Multi-Sig Wallet attack, and the integer\nunderflow/overflow attacks. These attacks were caused by a combination of\ntechnical flaws in designing and implementing software codes. However, many\nmore vulnerabilities of less severity are to be discovered because of the\nscripting natures of the Solidity language and the non-updateable feature of\nblockchains. Hence, we surveyed 16 security vulnerabilities in smart contract\nprograms, and some vulnerabilities do not have a proper solution. This survey\naims to identify the key vulnerabilities in smart contracts on Ethereum in the\nperspectives of their internal mechanisms and software security\nvulnerabilities. By correlating 16 Ethereum vulnerabilities and 19 software\nsecurity issues, we predict that many attacks are yet to be exploited. And we\nhave explored many software tools to detect the security vulnerabilities of\nsmart contracts in terms of static analysis, dynamic analysis, and formal\nverification. This survey presents the security problems in smart contracts\ntogether with the available analysis tools and the detection methods. We also\ninvestigated the limitations of the tools or analysis methods with respect to\nthe identified security vulnerabilities of the smart contracts.\n\n</td>

      <td>A Survey on Zero Knowledge Range Proofs and Applications</td>

One of the main topics of\ninterest, given its importance, is the research and development of privacy\nmechanisms, as for example is the case of Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). ZKP is a\ncryptographic technique that can be used to hide information that is put into\nthe ledger, while still allowing to perform validation of this data. In this\nwork we describe different strategies to construct Zero Knowledge Range Proofs\n(ZKRP), as for example the scheme proposed by Boudot in 2001; the one proposed\nin 2008 by Camenisch et al, and Bulletproofs, proposed in 2017. We also compare\nthese strategies and discuss possible use cases. Since Bulletproofs is the most\nefficient construction, we will give a detailed description of its algorithms\nand optimizations. Bulletproofs is not only more efficient than previous\nschemes, but also avoids the trusted setup, which is a requirement that is not\ndesirable in the context of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and blockchain.\nIn case of cryptocurrencies, if the setup phase is compromised, it would be\npossible to generate money out of thin air. Interestingly, Bulletproofs can\nalso be used to construct generic Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), in the sense\nthat it can be used to prove generic statements, and thus it is not only\nrestricted to ZKRP, but it can be used for any kind of Proof of Knowledge\n(PoK). Hence Bulletproofs leads to a more powerful tool to provide privacy for\nDLT. Here we describe in detail the algorithms involved in Bulletproofs\nprotocol for ZKRP. Also, we present our implementation, which was open sourced.\n\n</td>

      <td>Defining Smart Contract Defects on Ethereum</td>
      <td>\nAbstract:  Smart contracts are programs running on a blockchain. They are immutable to\nchange, and hence can not be patched for bugs once deployed. Thus it is\ncritical to ensure they are bug-free and well-designed before deployment. A\nContract defect is an error, flaw or fault in a smart contract that causes it\nto produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways.\nThe detection of contract defects is a method to avoid potential bugs and\nimprove the design of existing code. Since smart contracts contain numerous\ndistinctive features, such as the gas system. decentralized, it is important to\nfind smart contract specified defects. To fill this gap, we collected\nsmart-contract-related posts from Ethereum StackExchange, as well as real-world\nsmart contracts. We manually analyzed these posts and contracts; using them to\ndefine 20 kinds of contract defects. We categorized them into indicating\npotential security, availability, performance, maintainability and reusability\nproblems. To validate if practitioners consider these contract as harmful, we\ncreated an online survey and received 138 responses from 32 different\ncountries. Feedback showed these contract defects are harmful and removing them\nwould improve the quality and robustness of smart contracts. We manually\nidentified our defined contract defects in 587 real world smart contract and\npublicly released our dataset. Finally, we summarized 5 impacts caused by\ncontract defects. These help developers better understand the symptoms of the\ndefects and removal priority.\n\n</td>

A wide spectrum of blockchain\nconsensus protocols are then carefully reviewed accompanied by algorithmic\nabstractions and vulnerability analyses. The surveyed consensus protocols are\nanalyzed using the five-component framework and compared with respect to\ndifferent performance metrics. These analyses and comparisons provide us new\ninsights in the fundamental differences of various proposals in terms of their\nsuitable application scenarios, key assumptions, expected fault tolerance,\nscalability, drawbacks and trade-offs.

Yet,\nimmutability, a hitherto indisputable property according to which blockchain\ndata cannot be edited nor deleted, remains the cornerstone of blockchain's\nsecurity. Nevertheless, blockchain's immutability is being called into question\nlately in the light of the new erasing requirements imposed by the GDPR's\n``\textit{Right to be Forgotten (RtbF)}'' provision. As the RtbF obliges\nblockchain data to be editable in order restricted content redactions,\nmodifications or deletions to be applied when requested, blockchains compliance\nwith the regulation is indeed challenging, if not impracticable. Towards\nresolving this contradiction, various methods and techniques for mutable\nblockchains have been proposed in an effort to satisfy regulatory erasing\nrequirements while preserving blockchains' security.

      <td>\nAbstract:  Blockchain has been regarded as a promising technology for Internet of Things\n(IoT), since it provides significant solutions for decentralized network which\ncan address trust and security concerns, high maintenance cost problem, etc.\nThe decentralization provided by blockchain can be largely attributed to the\nuse of consensus mechanism, which enables peer-to-peer trading in a distributed\nmanner without the involvement of any third party. This article starts from\nintroducing the basic concept of blockchain and illustrating why consensus\nmechanism plays an indispensable role in a blockchain enabled IoT system. Then,\nwe discuss the main ideas of two famous consensus mechanisms including Proof of\nWork (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), and list their limitations in IoT. Next,\ntwo mainstream Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) based consensus mechanisms, i.e., the\nTangle and Hashgraph, are reviewed to show why DAG consensus is more suitable\nfor IoT system than PoW and PoS. Potential issues and challenges of DAG based\nconsensus mechanism to be addressed in the future are discussed in the last.\n\n</td>

It applies a linked block structure to verify and store data, and applies the trusted consensus mechanism to synchronize changes in data, which makes it possible to create a tamper-proof digital platform for storing and sharing data. It is believed that blockchain can be utilized in diverse Internet interactive systems (e.g., Internet of Things, supply chain systems, identity management, and so on). However, there are some privacy challenges that may hinder the applications of blockchain. The goal of this survey is to provide some insights into the privacy issues associated with blockchain. We analyze the privacy threats in blockchain and discuss existing cryptographic defense mechanisms, i.e., anonymity and transaction privacy preservation. Furthermore, we summarize some typical implementations of privacy preservation mechanisms in blockchain and explore future research challenges that still need to be addressed in order to preserve privacy when blockchain is used.</td>

      <td>AbstractAfter its introduction in 2008, increasing Bitcoin prices and a booming number of other cryptocurrencies lead to a growing discussion of how much energy is consumed during the production of these currencies. Being the most expensive and the most popular cryptocurrency, both the business world and the research community have started to question the energy intensity of Bitcoin mining. This paper only focuses on computational power demand during the proof-of-work process rather than estimating the whole energy intensity of mining. We make use of 160GB of Bitcoin blockchain data to estimate the energy consumption and power demand of Bitcoin mining. We considered the performance of 269 different hardware models (CPU, GPU, FPGA, and ASIC). For estimations, we defined two metrics, namely; minimum consumption and maximum consumption. The targeted time span for the analysis was from 3 January 2009 to 5 June 2018. We show that the historical peak of power consumption of Bitcoin mining took place during the bi-weekly period commencing on 18 December 2017 with a demand of between 1.3 and 14.8 GW. This maximum demand figure was between the installed capacities of Finland (∼16 GW) and Denmark (∼14 GW). We also show that, during June 2018, energy consumption of Bitcoin mining from difficulty recalculation was between 15.47 and 50.24 TWh per year.</td>

Bitcoin is a currency that is used digitally and globally as a system currency. It permits people to send and receive cash through the internet, even to a less-trusted person. Money can also be exchanged without knowing the real identity. The mathematics of cryptography form the fundamentals of bitcoin’s security. Cryptocurrency wallets also get hacked usually, but the hack is not the usual one, outstanding at the blockchain itself. Chain is a company that creates cryptographic ledgers like blockchains for security in financial services. The tools helped banks and credit-card companies to securely store and manage their assets.

      <td>On the Efficiency of Privacy-Preserving Smart Contract Systems</td>
      <td>Along with blockchain technology, smart contracts have found intense interest in lots of practical applications. A smart contract is a mechanism involving digital assets and some parties, where the parties deposit assets into the contract and the contract redistributes the assets among the parties based on provisions of the smart contract and inputs of the parties. Recently, several smart contract systems are constructed that use zk-SNARKs to provide privacy-preserving payments and interconnections in the contracts (e.g. Hawk [KMS+16] and Gyges [JKS16]). Efficiency of such systems severely are dominated by efficiency of the underlying UC-secure zk-SNARK that is achieved using C\(\emptyset \)C\(\emptyset \) framework [KZM+15] applied on a non-UC-secure zk-SNARK. In this paper, we show that recent progresses on zk-SNARKs, allow one to simplify the structure and also improve the efficiency of both systems with a UC-secure zk-SNARK that has simpler construction and better efficiency in comparison with the currently used ones. More precisely, with minimal changes, we present a variation of Groth and Maller’s zk-SNARK from Crypto 2017, and show that it achieves UC-security and has better efficiency than the ones that currently are used in Hawk and Gyges. We believe, new variation can be of independent interest.\n\n</td>

The research findings help researchers, regulators, and cryptocurrency developers to better understand their consumer's intention toward cryptocurrency adoption.</td>

      <td>A survey on blockchain cybersecurity vulnerabilities and possible countermeasures</td>
      <td>SummaryBlockchain technology has attracted considerable attention owing to its wide range of potential applications. It first appeared as a cryptocurrency, called Bitcoin, but has since been used in many other business and nonbusiness applications. Unlike most existing systems that are based on centralized frameworks, this new technology utilizes peer‐to‐peer networks and distributed systems which includes blockchain registers to store transactions. Its structure is designed as a digital log file and stored as a series of linked groups, called blocks. Each individual block is locked cryptographically with the previous block. Once a block has been added, it cannot be altered. Many security experts speculate that the inherent cryptographic nature of the blockchain system is sufficient to withstand constant hacking and security threats. However, previous studies on the security and privacy of blockchain technology have shown that many applications have fallen victim to successful cyberattacks. Owing to the increasing demand for cryptocurrency and its current security challenges, previous studies have not focused on blockchain technology cybersecurity vulnerabilities extensively. Here, our study extends upon the previous studies on vulnerabilities and investigates the types of potential attacks. Our study then provides further direction to highlight possible countermeasures against blockchain technology vulnerability to cybersecurity.Study presents a review on security threats and vulnerabilities in existing cryptocurrency systems that include the possibility of attacks with a focus on issues related to user privacy and transaction anonymity. The real attacks on blockchain systems are investigated, and current possible countermeasure methods by attack types are discussed. Furthermore, practical and academic merits to enhance the security of blockchain and limitations of state‐of‐the‐art security solutions are summarized and discussed, and future directions in area of blockchain security are suggested.\n\n                        View Figure\n</td>

The will to foster and guide this phenomenon has been summarized in the expression &amp;#x201C;Industry 4.0&amp;#x201D; (I4.0). Initiatives under this term share the vision that many key technologies underlying Cyber-Physical Systems and Big Data Analytics are converging to a new distributed, highly automated, and highly dynamic &lt;italic&gt;production network&lt;/italic&gt;, and that this process needs regulatory and cultural advancements to effectively and timely develop. In this work, we focus on the technological aspect only, highlighting the unprecedented complexity of I4.0 emerging from the scientific literature. While previous works have focused on one or up to four related enablers, we consider ten technological enablers, including besides the most cited Big Data, Internet of Things, and Cloud Computing, also others more rarely considered as Fog and Mobile Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Human-Computer Interaction, Robotics, down to the often overlooked, very recent, or taken for granted Open-Source Software, Blockchain, and the Internet. For each we explore the main characteristics in relation to I4.0 and its interdependencies with other enablers. Finally we provide a detailed analysis of challenges in leveraging each of the enablers in I4.0, evidencing possible roadblocks to be overcome and pointing at possible future directions of research. Our goal is to provide a reference for the experts in some of the technological fields involved, for a reconnaissance of integration and hybridization possibilities with other fields in the endeavor of I4.0, as well as for the laymen, for a high-level grasp of the variety (and often deep history) of the scientific research backing I4.0.</td>

      <td>Blockchain technology is growing massively where the number of blockchain platforms and decentralized applications are increasing rapidly in the last years. However, most of the existing blockchain networks are operating in a standalone environment isolated from each other, which increases scalability and connectivity issues in the current blockchain platforms as well as limiting the blockchain adoption in industry ecosystems. In the current phase, different blockchain networks don't have mutual trust where they cannot interact with each other and their capacity level has only reached a level similar to LAN. Due to the high barriers between the independent isolated blockchain platforms, researchers have started to focus on the concept of Blockchain interoperability. Blockchain interoperability is the ability of connecting multiple blockchain networks together, which significantly increases and solves scalability and connectivity issues in the blockchain platforms. Given the potential of blockchain interoperability and cross blockchain communication, many researchers are working on finding the optimal cross blockchain communication solution. As blockchain interoperability is emerging as an essential blockchain feature, the number of proposed blockchain interoperability solutions have been increasing within the last few years. In this paper, a survey of all the available cross blockchain communication solutions are discussed with a comparison of the proposed architectures.</td>

At the core of this interest are the ways in which blockchains can be used to improve data management, e.g., by enabling federated data management via decentralization, resilience against failure and malicious actors via replication and consensus, and strong data provenance via a secured immutable ledger.In practice, high-performance blockchains for data management are usually built in permissioned environments in which the participants are vetted and can be identified. In this setting, blockchains are typically powered by Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocols. These consensus protocols are used to provide full replication among all honest blockchain participants by enforcing an unique order of processing incoming requests among the participants.In this tutorial, we take an in-depth look at Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus. First, we take a look at the theory behind replicated computing and consensus. Then, we delve into how common consensus protocols operate.

As the oil and gas industry is gradually shifting toward intelligence and digitalization, many large oil and gas companies were working on blockchain technology in the past two years because of it can significantly improve the management level, efficiency, and data security of the oil and gas industry. This paper aims to let more people in the oil and gas industry understand the blockchain and lead more thinking about how to apply the blockchain technology. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the earliest papers on the review of the blockchain system in the oil and gas industry. This paper first presents the relevant theories and core technologies of the blockchain, and then describes how the blockchain is applied to the oil and gas industry from four aspects: trading, management and decision making, supervision, and cyber security. Finally, the application status, the understanding level of the blockchain in the oil and gas industry, opportunities, challenges, and risks and development trends are analyzed. The main conclusions are as follows: 1) at present, Europe and Asia have the fastest pace of developing the application of blockchain in the oil and gas industry, but there are still few oil and gas blockchain projects in operation or testing worldwide; 2) nowadays, the understanding of blockchain in the oil and gas industry is not sufficiently enough, the application is still in the experimental stage, and the investment is not enough; and (3) blockchain can bring many opportunities to the oil and gas industry, such as reducing transaction costs and improving transparency and efficiency. However, since it is still in the early stage of the application, there are still many challenges, primarily technological, and regulatory and system transformation. The development of blockchains in the oil and gas industry will move toward hybrid blockchain architecture, multi-technology combination, cross-chain, hybrid consensus mechanisms, and more interdisciplinary professionals.</td>

Data security assures that shared data is kept secure. In the network, data security is crucial against attackers and hackers. The data security is all about first to secure the information from pirated access and the second one is to protect from thwart hackers. The objective of network security is to keep the network running and safe for all legitimate users. The target of this paper is to present the merits and demerits of blockchain over data security in different sectors. The blockchain technology is used in various applications to store exchanges of values via transactions. All transactions made by nodes are signed digitally with the preceding transaction hash and the public key of the destination node; this scheme guarantees that transactions are tamper-proof. A block containing transactions will be approved by specific blockchain nodes. In block-chain technology, each page in a ledger of transactions forms a block. That block affects the next block or page through cryptographic hashing. In other words, when a block is finally completed, it creates a special secure code, that links to the next page or block, creating a chain of blocks, or block-chain. Data security can be accomplished using the block-chain concept. The hash tables of raw data files are stored on the blockchain, and other copies are validated by a hashing technique. Thus any interference with the data will be instantly found because the initial hash tables are stored on thousands of nodes.</td>

      <td>A blockchain is a distributed ledger of records called as blocks. These blocks are linked using cryptographic hash. Each block contains a hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. Consensus layer is the main layer in Blockchain Architecture, in which consensus protocol is configured to decide how new block is added in blockchain. Consensus algorithm solves the problem of trust in blockchain. Consensus algorithms can be classified into two classes. The first class is voting-based consensus, which requires nodes in the blockchain network to broadcast their results of mining a new block or transaction, before appending the block to blockchain. The second class is proof-based consensus, which requires the nodes joining the blockchain network to solve and mathematical puzzle to show that they are more eligible than the others to do the appending or mining work. Performance of blockchain can be increased with the use of suitable consensus algorithm. However, theory and data support for the selecting suitable consensus in private blockchain is very limited. This paper contributes theory and data used for selecting suitable consensus algorithm and would help researchers for further exploring of consensus in private blockchain environment.</td>

In April 2018, the UAE government launched a Blockchain Strategy of 2021. Under this initiative, 50 percent of government transactions will be processed over a BC platform. Eleven billion dirhams are expected to be saved in transactions and documents prepared in the government sector. The UAE 2021 strategy includes four pillars, focusing on residence happiness, government efficiency, advanced legislation, and global entrepreneurship. In October 2016, the emirate of Dubai, launched a local BC strategy to become the first energy-powered city that leads the future economy by 2020. This motivation placed the Government of UAE as a unique and pioneered country in innovation and enabling the ecosystem to be addressed in both the public and private sectors. This strategy is based on three domains: government effectiveness, industry innovation, and international, domestic leadership. BC projects will be experimenting throughout the country in many sectors such as energy, transportation, logistics, tourism, health, education and employment, economic development, safety and justice, social services, municipal and land works. This paper study the state of art of the UAE strategy towards adopting BC technology among all its entities. A survey has been conducted to evaluate the strategic effectiveness of this new technology. The study involves a combination of 71 public and private companies that operate in the UAE. The outcome shows that there is a need to integrate this technology. At the same time, the survey concluded that 92.0% of the companies are aware of the technology.

The smart contract is one of the most important features in blockchain applications, which implements trusted transactions without third parties. However, with the rapid development, blockchain smart contracts have also exposed many security problems, and some attacks caused by contract vulnerabilities have led to terrible losses. In order to better deal with such dilemma, making a comprehensive survey about the security verification of blockchain smart contracts from major scientific databases is quite indispensable. Even though the significance of studying security verification of blockchain smart contracts is evident, it is really fresh yet. The major contributions of our survey work come from three aspects. First, after retrieving all-sided research studies, we select 53 most related papers to show the state-of-the art of this topic, where 20 papers focus on dealing with security assurance of blockchain smart contracts, and 33 papers focus on the correctness verification of blockchain smart contracts. Second, we propose a taxonomy toward the topic of security verification of blockchain smart contracts and discuss the pros and cons of each category of related studies. Third, through in-depth analysis of these studies, we come to know that the correctness verification of smart contracts based on the formal method has already become the more significant and more effective method to validate whether a smart contract is credible and accurate. So, we further present representative studies of formal verification of smart contracts in detail to demonstrate that using a formal method to validate blockchain smart contracts must have a promising and meritorious future.</td>

      <td>Survey of Formal Verification Methods for Smart Contracts on Blockchain</td>
      <td>Due to the immutable nature of distributed ledger technology such as blockchain, it is of utter importance that a smart contract works as intended before employment outside test network. This is since any bugs or errors will become permanent once published to the live network, and could lead to substantial economic losses; as manifested in the infamous DAO smart contract exploit hack in 2016. In order to avoid this, formal verification methods can be used to ensure that the contract behaves according to given specifications. This paper presents a survey of the state of the art of formal verification of smart contracts. Being a relatively new research area, a standard or best practice for formal verification of smart contracts has not yet been established. Thus, several different methods and approaches have been used to perform the formal verification. The survey presented in this paper shows that some variant of model checking or theorem proving methodology seems to be most successful. However, as of today, formal verification is only successful on simple contracts, and does not support more advanced smart contract syntax.</td>

An integral part of the blockchain stack is the proof system, namely the mechanism efficiently verifying the claims of various blockchain stakeholders. Thus, trust is effectively established in a literally trustless environment with purely computational means. This is especially critical in the digital formulation of smart contracts where clauses are to be strictly upheld by intelligent agents. The most prominent proof systems recently proposed in the scientific literature are reviewed. Additionally, the applications of blockchain technology to smart contracts is discussed. The latter allows clause re-negotiation, increasing thus the flexibility factor in transactions.

In the last two decades, numerous IoT solutions have been developed by small, medium-sized, and large enterprises to make our lives easier. Furthermore, private and academic researchers have extensively investigated some practical IoT solutions. The rapid expansion of IoT solutions accompanies numerous security concerns because the underlying IoT protocols and communication technologies have not considered security. Recently, blockchain has emerged to become one of the promising technologies that might overcome some of the IoT limitations (security limitations, in particular). Blockchain technology is a database ledger that uses a peer-to-peer (P2P) network and stores transactions and asset registries. Blockchain can be described as a mounting list of records (i.e., blocks) with the following properties: distributed, decentralized, immutable, and shared. This paper surveyed recent security advances to overcome IoT limitations using blockchain. In this article, the blockchain attempts to overcome IoT limitations that are related to cyber security have been classified into four categories: end-to-end traceability; data privacy and anonymity; identity verification and authentication; and confidentiality, data integrity, and availability (CIA). Intended as a guideline for future research, this paper also explores systematic processes.</td>

      <td>Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that has gained significant attention and growth in recent years. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin does not rely on a centralized authority to control the supply, distribution, and verification of the validity of transactions. Instead, Bitcoin relies on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of volunteers to distribute pending transactions and confirmed blocks, to verify transactions, and to collectively implement a replicated ledger that everyone agrees on. This P2P network is at the heart of Bitcoin and many other blockchain technologies. In this paper, we present a comparative measurement study of nodes in the Bitcoin network. We measure and analyze how many the so-called “volunteers” are in the Bitcoin P2P network by scanning the live Bitcoin network for 37 days in 2018 and compare them with the data reported by prior work in 2013~2016. This paper is motivated by the fact that Bitcoin has experienced explosive growth in terms of a number of users, transactions, value, and interest over a recent couple of years. Our investigation includes the IP addresses of Bitcoin nodes, size of the network, power law in the geographic distribution, protocol, and client versions, and network latencies and shows how today's network is different from early days. In addition, based on the observations made from the measurement study, we propose a simple distance-based peer selection rule for improved connectivity and faster data propagation. The evaluation results show that our proposed lightweight and backward-compatible peer selection rule has the potential to reduce data dissemination latency.</td>

This leads to integrated product and service offerings and Industrial Product Service Systems (IPS2). Major challenges in this context are product tracking and tracing, the triggering of service and the delivery of service. A new technology that holds much promise in addressing these challenges is blockchain. In response, this study first introduces blockchain technology before it discusses major opportunities in the context of IPS2. For example, blockchain inherently creates a synchronized database of all transaction at each node while smart contracts allow for responsive action. However, there are also challenges. For example, large amounts of redundant data, irreversible contracts and, consequently, reduced competition. While blockchain holds much promise, more needs to be done to unlock its full potential in the context of IPS2.</td>

Three objectives were established to achieve this: (a) to present the first state-of-the-art and literature review on DLT in the built environment and construction industry providing a consolidated view of the applications explored and potential use cases that could support disruption of the construction industry. Seven use-categories were identified: [1] Smart Energy, [2] Smart Cities &amp; the Sharing Economy, [3] Smart Government, [4] Smart Homes, [5] Intelligent Transport, [6] BIM and Construction Management, and [7] Business Models and Organisational Structures; (b) to propose a framework for implementation composed of two conceptual models (i.e. the DLT Four-Dimensional Model, and the DLT Actors Model), developed according to extended socio-technical systems theory and including four dimensions (technical, social, process and policy), to support the development of DLT-based solutions that are adequate to the challenges faced by the construction industry. The DLT Four-Dimensional Model and the DLT Actors Model contribute to improve the understanding of the concepts involved when discussing DLT applications in construction and represent flexible, adaptable and scalable knowledge constructs and foundations that can be used for various further investigations; and (c) to appraise three specific use cases (i.e. Project Bank Accounts, regulation and compliance, and a single shared-access BIM model) as potential areas for DLT through the application of a decision support tool. The results show that Project Bank Accounts (PBAs) and regulation and compliance are candidate areas for DLT applications and warrant further attention. However, for the third use case (i.e. single shared-access BIM model) DLT are still insufficiently developed at this time.The research shows that there is real potential for DLT to support digitalisation in the construction industry and enable solutions to many of its challenges. However, there needs to be further investigation of the readiness of the industry, its organisations and processes, and to evaluate what changes need to occur before implementation can be successful. Further investigations will include the development of a roadmap process incorporating the four dimensions to evaluate readiness across a series of use cases for the construction industry.</td>

The Web came along a few years later and was the first layer on top of the Internet and allowed us to put content on the Internet that was easy to visualize, publish on, and share. More features were added to the Web including ecommerce, communication, and social media. Blockchain technology is a new layer that sits on top of the Internet, yet doesn’t need the World Wide Web—it is on par with the Web. On the long-term, blockchain has the potential to be of the same magnitude of the Web as a space — similar to what the Web gave us back in 1993–1994. (Mougayar 2016).</td>

      <td>Blockchain, as a decentralized network system, has been attracting increasing attention in recent years. In a blockchain system, there must be a consensus mechanism to ensure the distributed consensus among all parties. Such consensus mechanism may also be applied to guarantee fairness, correctness, and sustainability of such decentralized systems. In this paper, we propose a novel consensus mechanism, named Proof-of-Credibility (PoC), which is an improved version of Proof-of-Work (PoW). Compared with existing consensus mechanisms, PoC provides strong resistance to resource centralization and other malicious attacks. First, we present the Serial Mining Puzzle (SMP) to resist collusive mining. SMP guarantees that participants only get negligible advantage by parallel solving. Second, PoC considers the influence of participant credibility, which is reflected by the mining behaviour of a participant. Thus, credible participants get higher probability of winning the mining competition than incredible ones. Finally, the performance of PoC is analyzed in terms of common prefix, chain quality and power cost. Our analysis indicates that PoC is security and incentive compatible with suitable security parameter settings.\n</td>

However, critical in assessing whether blockchain can fulfill the hype of a technology characterized as ‘revolutionary’ and ‘disruptive’, is the need to ensure that blockchain design elements consider actual healthcare needs from the diverse perspectives of consumers, patients, providers, and regulators. In addition, answering the real needs of healthcare stakeholders, blockchain approaches must also be responsive to the unique challenges faced in healthcare compared to other sectors of the economy. In this sense, ensuring that a health blockchain is ‘fit-for-purpose’ is pivotal.

Depending on the application scenario considered, for some systems it may not be desirable to employ a fully decentralised approach. As such, in this paper we outline how our proposal can be adapted to allow for the minimal possible integration of blockchain technology in a traditional Access Control system.

Technically, the most impressive feature behind the success of Ethereum is its support for a Turing complete language. On the other hand, the inherent transparency and, consequently, the lack of privacy poses a great challenge for many financial applications. In this paper, we tackle this challenge and present a smart contract for a verifiable sealed-bid auction on the Ethereum blockchain. In a nutshell, initially, the bidders submit homomorphic commitments to their sealed-bids on the contract. Subsequently, they reveal their commitments secretly to the auctioneer via a public key encryption scheme. Then, according to the auction rules, the auctioneer determines and claims the winner of the auction. Finally, we utilize interactive zero-knowledge proof protocols between the smart contract and the auctioneer to verify the correctness of such a claim. The underlying protocol of the proposed smart contract is partially privacy-preserving. To be precise, no information about the losing bids is leaked to the bidders. We provide an analysis of the proposed protocol and the smart contract design, in addition to the estimated gas costs associated with the different transactions.</td>

However, if we consider most software failures are Byzantine failures (i.e., where components may fail and there is imperfect information on which a component has failed.) that might impair the operation but do not completely disable the production line. In this paper, we assume software practitioners who cause defects as Byzantine participants and claim that most software failures can be mitigated by viewing software development as the Byzantine Generals Problem. Consequently, we propose a test-driven incentive mechanism based on a blockchain concept to orchestrate the software development process where production is controlled by a similar infrastructure based on the working principles of blockchain.

The aim of this paper is first, to analyze the overall perspectives of blockchain technology and second, to investigate the potentials of blockchain to enable sustainable supply chains which would eliminate many shortcomings in current supply chains. This paper analyses three cases which exploited the potentials of blockchain technology with the aim of promoting sustainable sourcing from origin to consumers. The analysis compares three different cases of global supply chains, with a focus on corporate sustainability in agriculture, and manufactured goods. The results of our analysis show that blockchain has the potential to boost the supply chain sustainability, however the blockchain can’t guarantee that all supply chain stakeholders provide accurate, uniform and verifiable data. This paper provides a conceptual framework to better understand the benefits and challenges of the blockchain technology. Both academics and practitioners in companies might find this framework useful, as it outlines important lines of research in the field.</td>

It is, therefore, important for a government to ensure the efficiency of its tax collection system and to collect taxes in such a way that only minimal costs are incurred. Providing transparent, controllable, secure, and real-time information is vital in terms of ensuring the effectiveness of a tax collection system.

The properties and benefits of different blockchain technologies are analyzed in terms of both data and transparency. It has been concluded that blockchain technology could be applied in a number of areas to reduce the administrative tax burden and the costs associated with tax collection. This study, therefore, attempts to explain the applicability of blockchain technology in relation to taxation, and it clarifies (1) how blockchain technology represents a new approach to taxation, (2) how blockchain technology reduces tax expenditure, (3) how blockchain technology increases both transparency and accountability, (4) how tax evasion can be reduced using blockchain technology, and (5) how blockchain technology can reduce the administrative tax burden.</td>

All the transactions of cryptocurrencies are stored in chronological order to help users in tracking the transactions without maintaining any central record of the transactions. Application prospects of blockchain are promising and have been delivering the result since its inception. Blockchain technology has evolved from initial cryptocurrency to new-age smart contracts and has been implemented and applied in many fields. Although a lot of studies have been carried out on the security and privacy issues of blockchain, but a systematic examination on the security of blockchain systems is still missing. In this chapter, we will try to demonstrate a systematic illustration on the security threats to blockchain and survey the corresponding real attacks by examining popular blockchain systems. We will discuss the security and the privacy of blockchain along with their impact with regards to different trends and applications in this chapter. The chapter is intended to discuss key security attacks and the enhancements that will help develop better blockchain systems.</td>

Blockchain technology has widely been used in the finance and e-commerce industries for processing payments and smart contracts. Consensus algorithms, which are used to achieve agreement on data among distributed systems, are mostly determine by the type of blockchain, i.e. public, private, or federated, and are used for the verification and validation of transactions in such blockchain platforms. Current application of blockchain technology in the educational sector has mostly been for keeping student records, storing and validating diploma and degree certificate for academic credentials. Most of the available consensus algorithms for blockchain provide some form of reward to miners e.g. in the form of cryptocurrency. For blockchain to be adapted and used for other educational applications such as the creation of learning contents, the right consensus algorithm is needed. Since a Learning Content Creation will have little or no reward for participants and also not need “mining”, the consensus model selection will need to treat participants fairly so to not push them away. In this introductory paper, we briefly review the available consensus algorithms and provide our insight how the Blockchain framework can be adapted for instructional design and learning content creation. A proposed framework which will lead to further studies and the development of such system is discussed here.</td>

The volume and variety of data that are collected and processed in industries are ever increasing due to the widespread acceptance of modern technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, edge computing, and cloud storage. Conventional systems with centralized architecture are not designed to handle the complexity and scale of data that is processed in IIoT operations. Moreover, the threat of security and privacy breaches also increases with the growth of IIoT-connected devices. IoT devices often tend to have poor security defense systems due to low processing power, limited storage capabilities, and poor manufacturing standards. In this context, blockchain technology can help to eliminate the security vulnerabilities faced by the IIoT systems and provides extensive protection from data thefts, cyberattacks, and data corruption. Blockchain with its distributed architecture offers peer-to-peer networking and enables auditable and transparent transactions. This chapter explores the concept of IIoT and its limitations, and the need for deploying blockchain mechanisms in the IIoT paradigm. We further analyze blockchain technology and how it can reinforce IIoT systems. Existing systems of blockchain in the IIoT ecosystems and relevant use cases are also explored. As conventional systems struggle to handle the scale of data operations handled by the IIoT, blockchain has emerged as a viable solution to reinforce and reform existing systems.</td>

Supporters of a blockchain called the “internet of values” argue that it sustains a more reliable infrastructure without any intermediary, unlike traditional systems that include regulators and intermediaries. Blockchains established by private institutions for intercompany operations give the decision-making authority of record approvals and monitoring ledgers to the system’s managers.

      <td>Emerging blockchain technology has introduced a new challenge to the distributed system research: Can Byzantine fault-tolerance protocols scale up to, for example, hundreds of nodes? In this work, we introduce HiBFT, a hierarchical Byzantine fault-tolerance protocol to address the problem. The core idea is to divide replicas into groups and exchange consensus messages among groups, thus avoiding the necessity of message broadcasting. The motivation for such approach bases on the hierarchical property of network architecture in permissioned block chains, our target deployments. HiBFT works very much in the same way as the classical Practical Byzantine Fault-Tolerance protocol. However, it replaces the concept of physical replica with a logical one that represents a replica group. As such, protocol message complexity can be reduced from \(O(N^2)\) to \(O(s^2)\) where N and s are the total number of replicas and the number of groups. Additionally, using threshold signature scheme for representing a logical group results in two important improvements: The cost of signature verification is significantly reduced at each replica; blocks can be secured more effectively in terms of signature size. Our protocol guarantees safety and liveness under partially synchronous assumption with a correctness proof. Our experiment results show that the protocol can scale up to hundred of nodes.</td>

For example, it is widely acknowledged that the Internet-of-Things (IoT) has introduced complexity to the cyberspace, however, incident responders should also realise the advantages presented by these new “Digital Witnesses” (DW) to support their investigation. Logs generated by IoT devices can help in the process of event reconstruction, but their integrity -and therefore admissibility- can be achieved only if a Chain-of-Custody (CoC) is maintained within the wider context of an on-going digital investigation. Likewise, the transition to electronic documentation improves data availability, legibility, the utility of notes, and therefore enhances the communication between stakeholders. However, without a proof of validity, these data could be falsified. For example, in an application area such as eHealth, there is a requirement to maintain various existing (and new) rules and regulations concerning authorship, auditing, and the integrity of medical records. Lacking data control could lead to system abuse, fraud and severe compromise of service quality. These concerns can be resolved by implementing an online CoC. In this paper, we discuss the value and means of utilising Blockchain in modern systems to support DFIR. we demonstrate the value of Blockchain to improve the implementation of Digital Forensic Models and discuss why law enforcement and incident responders need to understand Blockchain technology. Furthermore, the admissibility of a Digital Evidence to a Court of Law requires chronological documentation. Hence, we discuss how the CoC can be sustained based on a distributed ledger. Finally, we provide a practical scenario related to eHealth to demonstrate the value of this approach to introduce forensic readiness to computer systems and enable better Police interventions.</td>

Together with relatively new concepts such as Open Data, blockchain stands a chance to be practically utilised in different socio-economic establishments.

Several approches address such issues however, among these blockchain provides a viable solution which has received wide acceptance in the recent past. Permissioned blockchain solutions adopt more efficient consensus algorithms and smart contracts. There are many smart-contract solutions exists (such as, etherium, IBM blockchain, hyperledger fabric), however, much of them mainly follow traditional access control models. A role-based access control model provides controlled access of resources to members. This research work presents an extended usage control model known as DistU (Distributed Usage Control). DistU is proposed to capture all possible access control models required by a business for permissioned blockchain frameworks. DistU can monitor a resource continuously during the operation and update the attributes accordingly, performing different actions, such as denying or revoking permissions. We believe that the proposed DistU usage control model can provide a fine-grained control for blockchain resource management. The paper also contributes to provide a protoype implementation of fine-grained permission model on Hyperledger Fabric. The reason of selecting Fabric for this research is that, it is the first execute-order achitecture blockchain that provides a platform to develop general business applciations. Secondly, it is an opensource operating system of permissioned blockchain with huge industry support.</td>

In: International conference on computational social networks. Springer: New York; 2018. p. 25–40) both “from exponential to phase-type” service times and “from Poisson to MAP” transaction arrivals. Note that the MAP transaction arrivals and the two stages of PH service times make our blockchain queue more suitable to various practical conditions of blockchain systems with crucial factors, for example, the mining processes, the block generations, the blockchain building and so forth. For such a more general blockchain queueing model, we focus on two basic research aspects: (1) using the matrix-geometric solution, we first obtain a sufficient stable condition of the blockchain system. Then, we provide simple expressions for the average stationary number of transactions in the queueing waiting room and the average stationary number of transactions in the block. (2) However, on comparing with Li et al. (2018), analysis of the transaction–confirmation time becomes very difficult and challenging due to the complicated blockchain structure. To overcome the difficulties, we develop a computational technique of the first passage times by means of both the PH distributions of infinite sizes and the RG factorizations. Finally, we hope that the methodology and results given in this paper will open a new avenue to queueing analysis of more general blockchain systems in practice and can motivate a series of promising future research on development of blockchain technologies.</td>

      <td>Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain as a Service for the IoT: Proof of Concept</td>
      <td>\nBlockchain as a Service for the Internet of Things is an emerging topic in the blockchain research and industrial community, especially relating to increased system consistency, security, and privacy. Blockchains represent highly distributed and autonomous decision-making systems with distributed data and process management. Internet of Things systems share these characteristics, while also bringing the cyber-physical dimension and machine-to-machine interaction concept to the ecosystem of devices and users. Blockchain infrastructure setup and smart contract prototyping are cumbersome tasks. Onboarding an existing system to a blockchain network takes a significant amount of time and manual effort, and incorporating business logic requires a series of complex steps. For IoT systems, these task needs to be carried out having in mind the typical characteristics of such systems: low hardware, storage, and networking capabilities and high node churn and transaction volume. Moreover, these tasks need to be semi to fully automated in terms of workflows that support easy-to-use integration mechanisms for onboarding of diverse IoT infrastructures and on-demand business logic generation. In this paper, we present a Hyperledger Fabric-based Blockchain as a Service for addressing the identified challenges. Specifically, the framework is tailored to answer to specific requirements of IoT systems through three major services: Hyperledger Fabric Infrastructure Configuration Generator, Hyperledger Fabric Chaincode Builder and Hyperledger Fabric Operator Modules.</td>

      <td>Selfish Mining in Proof-of-Work Blockchain with Multiple Miners: An Empirical Evaluation</td>
      <td>Proof-of-Work blockchain, despite its numerous benefits, is still not an entirely secure technology due to the existence of Selfish Mining (SM) strategies that can disrupt the system and its mining economy. While the effect of SM has been studied mostly in a two-miners scenario, it has not been investigated in a more practical context where there are multiple malicious miners individually performing SM. To fill this gap, we carry out an empirical study that separately accounts for different numbers of SM miners (who always perform SM) and strategic miners (who choose either SM or Nakamoto’s mining protocol depending on which maximises their individual mining reward). Our result shows that SM is generally more effective as the number of SM miners increases, however its effectiveness does not vary in the presence of a large number of strategic miners. Under specific mining power distributions, we also demonstrate that multiple miners can perform SM and simultaneously gain higher mining rewards than they should. Surprisingly, we also show that the more strategic miners there are, the more robust the systems become. Since blockchain miners should naturally be seen as self-interested strategic miners, our findings encourage blockchain system developers and engineers to attract as many miners as possible to prevent SM and similar behaviour.</td>

Such health monitoring and support are getting immensely popular among both patients and doctors as it does not require physical movement which is always not possible for elderly people who lives mostly alone in current socio-economic situations. Healthcare Informatics plays a key role in such circumstances. The huge amount of raw data emanating from sensors needs to be processed applying machine learning and deep learning algorithms for useful information extraction to develop an intelligent knowledge base for providing an appropriate solution as and when required. The real challenge lies in data storage and retrieval preserving security, privacy, reliability and availability requirements. Health data saved in Electronic medical record (EMR) is generally saved in a client-server database where central coordinator does access control like create, access, update, or delete of health records. But in smart and remote healthcare supported by enabling technologies such as Sensors, Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud, Deep learning, Big data, etc. EMR needs to be accessed in a distributed manner among multiple stakeholders involved such as hospitals, doctors, research labs, patients’ relatives, insurance provider, etc. Hence, it is to be ensured that health data be protected from unauthorized access specifically to maintain data integrity using advanced distributed security techniques such as blockchain.\n</td>

Despite high expectations, the technology lacks real-world applications that go beyond cryptocurrencies and that convince with efficiency and effectiveness. The gap between visions and theory, on the one hand, and reality, on the other hand, triggered a debate on the future of blockchain and the role of IS research in shaping this future. However, researchers currently struggle to make meaningful quantitative analyses and predictions regarding where and how blockchain is efficiently and effectively applicable. One reason for this is conceptual fuzziness, to which this paper points out. The author identifies three issues, i.e., presence of (i.) terminological ambiguities, (ii.) concept proliferation and conceptual inconsistencies, and (iii.) technological determinism, which IS research needs to clarify if the discipline wants to make reliable predictions about compelling use cases of blockchain.</td>

IoT enables ubiquitous data collections and network communications to bring significant and indispensable convenience and intelligence both to daily life and industrial operations. However, IoT is still confronting a number of challenges and manifesting a series of issues that need to be addressed urgently. Counterfeit hardware, software faults, security issues during communication, system management difficulties, and data privacy issues are significant issues for current IoT infrastructure. Meanwhile, blockchain, as an emerging information technology, has attracted huge public interest and has shown significant promise because of its decentralization, transparency, and security. The features of blockchain seem to be an ideal match for IoT, and by applying blockchain to an IoT environment, some of the aforementioned weaknesses can be addressed. This paper’s purpose is to introduce the use of blockchain in IoT applications. We present various challenges facing an IoT system and summarize the benefits of adopting blockchain into IoT infrastructure. We primarily focus on illustrating the blockchain applications in IoT with refined capabilities and enhanced security. To shed light on blockchain in IoT research, we also discuss limitations and future directions.</td>

      <td>Revisiting Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance Through Blockchain Technologies</td>
      <td>The connection between Byzantine fault tolerance and cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, may not be apparent immediately. Byzantine fault tolerance is intimately linked to engineering and design challenges of developing long-running and safety-critical technical systems. Its origins can be traced back to the question of how to deal with faulty sensors in distributed systems and the fundamental insight that majority voting schemes may be insufficient to guarantee correctness if arbitrary, or so-called Byzantine failures, can occur. However, achieving resilience against Byzantine failures has its price, both in terms of the redundancy required within a system and the incurred communication overhead. Together with the complexity of correctly implementing Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocols, it may help to explain why BFT systems have not yet been widely deployed in practice, even though practical designs exist for almost 20 years. On the other hand, asking anyone about Bitcoin or blockchain 10 years ago would have only raised quizzical looks. Since then, the ecosphere surrounding blockchain technologies has grown from the pseudonymously published proposal for a peer-to-peer electronic cash system into a multi-billion-dollar industry. At the heart of this success story lies not only the technical innovations presented by Bitcoin but a colorful and diverse community that has succeeded in bridging gaps and bringing together various disciplines from academia and industry alike. Bitcoin reinvigorated interest in the topic of BFT as it was arguably the first system that achieved a practical form of Byzantine fault tolerance with a large and changing number of participants. Research into the fundamental principles and mechanisms behind the underlying blockchain technology of Bitcoin has since helped advance the field and state of the art regarding BFT protocols. This chapter will outline how these modern blockchain technologies relate to the field of Byzantine fault tolerance and outline advantages and disadvantages in their design decisions and fundamental assumptions. Thereby, we highlight that Byzantine fault tolerance should be considered a practical and fundamental building block for modern long-running and safety critical systems and that the principles, mechanisms, and blockchain technologies themselves could help improve the security and quality of such systems.</td>

Although blockchain emerged in the Internet commerce sector as an immutable and decentralized ledger system, it can now be seen as a framework for autonomous decentralized data processing which enforces a flat and open-access network. The primary security threat in Blockchain would be a compromise or fallacy in the Consensus mechanism. The Proof of concept (PoX) approach used in Blockchains has elegantly emulated the leader-election function required in a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocol to simulate the block proposal process. Proof of work (PoW), the consensus mechanism that the Bitcoin protocol employed paved the way for blockchain as a viable DLT for commerce on the internet. Many “alt-coins” subsequently came up, however PoW has saturated with the explosion of popularity of the crypto currency and other alt-coins have achieved sub-optimal solutions. There is the looming “51% attack” for resource pricing algorithms and various other attacks such as Bribe attacks, Sybil attacks and the Nothing-at-stake attack for the other alternate consensus mechanisms. The novel PoStack algorithm is a gamification of the node mining process, which enforces a simple notion: a node’s chance of mining crypto currency is proportional to its belief in a node that no one else believes in. The protocol has modest computational and financial needs, which reduces the barrier to entry.</td>

      <td>The paradigm of Internet-of-Things (IoT) is flooring the way of daily-life activities which are interconnected as well as interact with their environment in order to collect information and automate certain tasks. Therefore, the seamless authentication, data privacy, security, robustness against attacks, easy deployment, and self-maintenance among other things are the potential parameters of the systems which can be fetched by blockchain technology. This chapter systematically presents the adaption of blockchain technology to fulfil the specific demands of IoT in order to develop Blockchain-integrated IoT (BIoT) for medical applications/e-healthcare. With the discussion of basics of blockchain technology, the most relevant BIoT applications such as e-healthcare has been explored and its impact over traditional cloud-centred IoT applications is presented. Moreover, the present potential challenges and possible optimizations are detailed regarding several aspects that affect the design, development, and deployment of a BIoT application. Finally, the potential recommendations are numbered to guide the researchers/developers on the issues which will have to be commenced before deploying the next generation of BIoT applications.</td>

      <td>Using a blockchain, an application that guarantees reliability, can be realized by managing a distributed ledger of agreements. A blockchain’s usefulness in applications requiring trust, such as virtual currency, has been confirmed, and it is being used in actual services. However, the time taken to add data to the distributed ledger and the cost of this operation may be too high. As a result, other real applications for blockchains have not been found yet. In this research, we design and implement an application for lending and borrowing books on a distributed ledger. The application is implemented as a distributed application on Ethereum, which is a platform used for building blockchain-based smart contracts. Users of this application can lend and borrow books through a web application that functions as the user interface of the application. The usage logs show that the time and fees required for adding data to the distributed ledger are acceptable.</td>

      <td>The concept of blockchain born out of Bitcoin in just a decade ago has greatly attracted the attentions of industry and academia. The third generation of blockchain is believed to be able to support a large number of commercial and social applications with security, scalability, speed and developer friendly. To maintain a distributed ledger in many independent peer nodes without central authority, the consensus mechanism is the key protocol to construct a blockchain system with multiple technologies. However compared to the well-studied consensus protocols in public blockchain, the customized consensus mechanism is still lack of research for the consortium blockchain in both industry and academia, especially in the enterprise scenarios of applications and services. The layered consensus mechanism in the consortium blockchain is discussed after considering and combining the common characteristics of enterprise applications and services. Based on the famous Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), the new layered and service-oriented consensus mechanism should be more practical to apply the blockchain technology to much diversified enterprise services with decentralization and extensibility in the principle of enterprise-level security.</td>

      <td>A Novel Exploration for Blockchain in Distributed File Storage</td>
      <td>Distributed file storage provides reliable access to data through redundancy spread on distributed nodes. Various application scenarios emerge, such as include data centers, storage in wireless networks and peer-to-peer storage systems. Storing data by using code, such as an erasure code, calls for less redundancy compared with simple replication in terms of reliability. Nevertheless, since data fragments are periodically replaced when some nodes fail, a key acute question is how to generate encoded data fragments in a distributed way when transferring as little data as possible over the network. For a coded system, a new node to repair from a node failure is to download subsets of data from some surviving nodes, reconstructs some lost coded blocks by using the downloaded fragments, and stores them at the new node. This procedure is not optimal. In this paper, we introduce blockchain to protect distributed data in terms of node failure and etc. We show that blockchain can significantly improve the integrity and credibility in distributed file storage systems. Furthermore, we harvest theory discovery of blockchain in distributed file storage system.</td>

From the technological point of view, the blockchain is still far from a mainstream adoption, mainly due to scalability issues and because the interaction with it is still complex and requires technical skills. Given blockchain’s (and smart contracts’) advantages and technical limitations, it is difficult, for a company, to decide whether to invest in this technology or not, and to identify potential successful use cases. The objective of this chapter is to provide the reader with practical information to perform this choice. In particular, the chapter first provides a glossary of blockchain-related terms and then shows existing and under development use cases belonging to different sectors. Presented use cases are then discussed, to identify which sectors could benefit the most from blockchain and smart contracts, highlighting the most promising use cases in which this technology could be disrupting, and underlying the ones where advantages of relying on it are only marginal.</td>

On the other hand, Bitcoin uses a technology called Blockchain, which was founded on its peer-to-peer nature and lack of need for a trusted central authority. Cybersecurity of vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) has become a prime research area for cybersecurity researchers. Minor vulnerabilities in VANET may lead to severe fatalities. This concernment has engaged numerous researchers with the purpose of improving the defense mechanism of these susceptible networks.

Any security flaw occurring during authentication with a centralized environment affects the connectivity of devices in the network and the transaction of data in IoT. As a solution, Blockchain technology emerges to use in IoT network for the betterment. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is the collection of medical devices and applications that connect to healthcare IT systems. In IoMT environment, a private Blockchain network is created containing all the participants of a hospital including doctors, lab technicians, patients and clinical laboratories etc., There exists no necessity to carry the report by the patients during every visit, as the data is already available in the network. The data is completely decentralized to avoid failure, data loss and to provide faster recovery. Whenever a change is attempted by a third person in the database, a notification is sent to all the members of the group. Since this is a private Blockchain, it requires an additional level of authentication. Whenever any new person requires being a part of the network a document for proof is provided. The data is transparent, so any modification done by any member of the group will get notified to everyone. An additional level security can be provided for data transfer based upon the mutually agreed security parameter and any modification in database is accepted upon approval of all members. In addition, when a hospital is not able to provide any sophisticated treatment to the patient due to lack of medical facilities, recommendation is sent to the patient; thereby new hospital added to the private network after successful authentication to access patient’s record. To access record, quantum key may be generated and distributed across the network.\n</td>

      <td>\nAbstract:  The Selfdestruct function is provided by Ethereum smart contracts to destroy\na contract on the blockchain system. However, it is a double-edged sword for\ndevelopers. On the one hand, using Selfdestruct function enables developers to\nremove smart contracts (SC) from Ethereum and transfers Ethers when emergency\nsituations happen, e.g. being attacked. On the other hand, this function can\nincrease the complexity for the development and open an attack vector for\nattackers. To better understand the reasons why SC developers include or\nexclude the Selfdestruct function in their contracts, we conducted an online\nsurvey to collect feedback from them and summarize the key reasons. Their\nfeedback shows that 66.67% of the developers will deploy an updated contract to\nthe Ethereum after destructing the old contract. According to this information,\nwe propose a method to find the self-destruct contracts (also called\npredecessor contracts) and their updated version (successor contracts) by\ncomputing the code similarity. By analyzing the difference between the\npredecessor contracts and their successor contracts, we found six reasons that\nled to the death of the contracts; three of them (i.e., Unmatched ERC20 Token,\nConfusing Contract and Limits of Permission) might affect the life span of\ncontracts. We developed a tool named LifeScope to detect these problems.\nLifeScope reports 0 false positives or negatives in detecting Unmatched ERC20\nToken and Confusing Contract. In terms of Limits of Permission, LifeScope\nachieves 85.67% of F-measure and 0.9014 of AUC. According to the feedback of\ndevelopers who exclude Selfdestruct functions, we propose suggestions to help\ndevelopers use Selfdestruct functions in Ethereum smart contracts better.\n\n</td>

It is considered\na technological breakthrough anticipated to disrupt several application\ndomains. This has resulted in a plethora of blockchain systems for various\npurposes. However, many of these blockchain systems suffer from serious\nshortcomings related to their performance and security, which need to be\naddressed before any wide-scale adoption can be achieved. A crucial component\nof any blockchain system is its underlying consensus algorithm, which in many\nways, determines its performance and security. Therefore, to address the\nlimitations of different blockchain systems, several existing as well novel\nconsensus algorithms have been introduced. A systematic analysis of these\nalgorithms will help to understand how and why any particular blockchain\nperforms the way it functions. However, the existing studies of consensus\nalgorithms are not comprehensive. Those studies have incomplete discussions on\nthe properties of the algorithms and fail to analyse several major blockchain\nconsensus algorithms in terms of their scopes. This article fills this gap by\nanalysing a wide range of consensus algorithms using a comprehensive taxonomy\nof properties and by examining the implications of different issues still\nprevalent in consensus algorithms in detail. The result of the analysis is\npresented in tabular formats, which provides a visual illustration of these\nalgorithms in a meaningful way. We have also analysed more than hundred top\ncrypto-currencies belonging to different categories of consensus algorithms to\nunderstand their properties and to implicate different trends in these\ncrypto-currencies. Finally, we have presented a decision tree of algorithms to\nbe used as a tool to test the suitability of consensus algorithms under\ndifferent criteria.\n\n</td>

      <td>Who Watches the Watchmen? A Review of Subjective Approaches for Sybil-resistance in Proof of Personhood Protocols</td>
      <td>\nAbstract:  Most current self-sovereign identity systems may be categorized as strictly\nobjective, consisting of cryptographically signed statements issued by trusted\nthird party attestors. This failure to provide an input for subjectivity\naccounts for a central challenge: the inability to address the question of "Who\nverifies the verifier?". Instead, these protocols outsource their legitimacy to\nmechanisms beyond their internal structure, relying on traditional centralized\ninstitutions such as national ID issuers and KYC providers to verify the claims\nthey hold. This reliance has been employed to safeguard applications from a\nvulnerability previously thought to be impossible to address in distributed\nsystems: the Sybil attack problem, which describes the abuse of an online\nsystem by creating many illegitimate virtual personas. Inspired by the progress\nin cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, there has recently been a surge\nin networked protocols that make use of subjective inputs such as voting,\nvouching, and interpreting, to arrive at a decentralized and sybil-resistant\nconsensus for identity. In this article, we will outline the approaches of\nthese new and natively digital sources of authentication -- their attributes,\nmethodologies strengths, and weaknesses -- and sketch out possible directions\nfor future developments.\n\n</td>

In 2017-2019\nblockchain and associated technologies such as smart contracts has progressed\nbeyond cryptocurrencies, and has been adopted in banking, retail, healthcare,\nand other fields. This study critically examines recent applications of\nblockchain in science, touching upon different stages of research cycle, from\ndata management to publishing, peer review, research evaluation and funding.\nThe paper is based upon a review of blockchain projects, relevant literature, a\nset of interviews and focus groups with startup founders, scholars, librarians,\nIT experts from the EU, USA, Russia, and Belarus. Proponents of blockchain for\nscience present this technology as a tool to make science free from bias, red\ntape, data fraud, as well as provide innovative means to secure financial\nbacking for new ideas. However, these projects face a set of challenges. One\nissue concerns introducing crypto economy, with its financial incentives, into\nscience, a field that emphasizes disinterested and non-pecuniary pursuit of\ntruth. Another source of concern relates to the ongoing conflict between the\nprinciple of decentralization inherent to blockchain and the practice of\nforcing it from above, by the state and other centralized entities.\n\n</td>

      <td>\nAbstract:  Since its inception as a solution for secure cryptocurrencies sharing in\n2008, the blockchain technology has now become one of the core technologies for\nsecure data sharing and storage over trustless and decentralised peer-to-peer\nsystems. E-government is amongst the systems that stores sensitive information\nabout citizens, businesses and other affiliates, and therefore becomes the\ntarget of cyber attackers. The existing e-government systems are centralised\nand thus subject to single point of failure. This paper proposes a secure and\ndecentralised e-government system based on the consortium blockchain\ntechnology, which is a semi-public and decentralised blockchain system\nconsisting of a group of pre-selected entities or organisations in charge of\nconsensus and decisions making for the benefit of the whole network of peers.\nIn addition, a number of e-government nodes are pre-selected to perform the\ntasks of user and transaction validation before being added to the blockchain\nnetwork. Accordingly, e-government users of the consortium blockchain network\nare given the rights to create, submit, access, and review transactions.\nPerformance evaluation on single transaction time and transactions processed\nper second demonstrate the practicability of the proposed consortium\nblockchain-based e-government system for secure information sharing amongst all\nstakeholders.\n\n</td>

The main advantages of blockchain for its potential use in other areas are its inherent security mechanisms and immunity to data manipulation attacks. A blockchain relies on a consensus method for agreeing on any new data. Most of the consensus methods which are currently used for the blockchain of different cryptocurrencies require high computational power and thus are not suitable for resource-constrained systems.In this article, we survey the various blockchain-based consensus methods that are applicable to resource-constrained IoT devices and networks. In a typical IoT network, there exist several devices with limited computational and communication capabilities. Most often, these devices cannot perform intensive computations and are starved for bandwidth. Therefore, we discuss the possible measures that can be taken to reduce the computational power and convergence time for the underlying consensus methods. We also talk about some of the alternatives to the public blockchain, such as private blockchain and tangle, along with their potential adoption for IoT networks. Furthermore, we review the existing consensus methods that have been implemented and explore the possibility of utilizing them to realize a blockchain-based IoT network. Some of the open research challenges including AI-enabled blockchains are also put forward.</td>

In this paper, a comparative and analytical review on the state-of-the-art blockchain consensus algorithms is presented to enlighten the strengths and constraints of each algorithm. Based on their inherent specifications, each algorithm has a different domain of applicability that yields to propose several performance criteria for the evaluation of these algorithms. To overview and provide a basis of comparison for further work in the field, a set of incommensurable and conflicting performance evaluation criteria is identified and weighted by the pairwise comparison method. These criteria are classified into four categories including algorithms’ throughput, the profitability of mining, degree of decentralization and consensus algorithms vulnerabilities and security issues. Based on the proposed framework, the pros and cons of consensus algorithms are systematically analyzed and compared in order to provide a deep understanding of the existing research challenges and clarify the future study directions.</td>

Ideally, blockchains are designed to be architecturally and politically decentralized, similar to the Internet. In recent times, however, blockchain-based systems have faced stumbling blocks in the form of challenges related to scalability, privacy, security, etc. Several new methods have been proposed both by the research and professional communities to mitigate these challenges. One such recent advancement proposed is the use of sidechains. A sidechain is a secondary blockchain connected to the main blockchain with a two-way peg. Sidechains may have their own consensus protocols, which could be completely different from the mainchain's protocol. Theoretically, a sidechain can add new functionalities, improve privacy, and security of traditionally vanilla blockchains. To this date, however, little is known or discussed regarding factors related to design choices, feasibility, limitations and other issues in adopting the sidechain technology. Moreover, there is a lack of studies discussing how and where it can effectively be integrated into blockchains to remedy current issues in a clear context. Hence, this paper provides the first comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art sidechains and platforms, identifying current advancements and analyzing their impact from various viewpoints, highlighting their limitations and discussing possible remedies for the overall improvement of the blockchain domain.</td>

      <td>Overview of Blockchain Technology Concepts</td>
      <td>AbstractBlockchain technology (BCT) has perhaps gained widespread attention around the world for roughly a decade. Since the technology was coined, researcher’s focus shifted to explore the insights of the technology. Nakamoto first introduced the concept of digital currency or cryptocurrency. Decentralized systems are the backbone of these cryptocurrencies and the technology behind these currencies are blockchain. Blockchain is a distributed ledger and one of the most promising, disruptive and revolutionary technology of today. Initially, all communities in the world believed that Bitcoin is blockchain and many myths were around what the technology is and impact of that technology in business applications. Later, an influence of core technology behind the Bitcoin had transformed the perception of the researchers, industrialists, and academicians in various domains such as Banking, Healthcare, Government, and so on.In order to know BCT in depth, the basic understanding of BCT concepts and key terms are to be explored in this chapter. Blockchain consists of chain of consecutive blocks of transactions. Traditional client/server systems are following client/server architecture and controlled by multiple administrators. But, BCT is a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) network and distributed in nature. Each and every participant of the network can control the network. BCT network consists of many computers connected together and the block cannot be altered without consensus of the whole network. Block can be considered as a container for the data. Computers in the blockchain network are called nodes and each node has copy of the digital ledger.Blockchain is continuously growing chain of blocks which are interconnected and protected with the help of cryptographic functions also. Validating of new blocks is followed by a set of protocols and consensus from every participant of the network. The records are stored in linear chain. Pointers and linked list data structures are used in blockchain for the block representation. Blocks are arranged in sequence and lined with each other using linked list. Pointers are used to point the location of the next block. Block is a collection of data that stores the transaction details such as timestamp, link to the previous block which is generated by secure hash algorithm. Every block has contains two parts: block header and block body.Blockchain is characterized by consensus, distributed computation, immutability, and authentication. Since blockchain is a budding technology, different types of applications require different types of blockchains. Permissionless or public blockchain does not have any control. Anyone can read or write into the network. At the same time, permissioned ledgers are restricted to authenticated users of the network. All blocks are encrypted by a private key and cannot be interpreted by anyone. Consortium blockchains are the combination of both the public and private blockchains.With the perspective of software architecture, understanding the working model of blockchain helps in implementation of technology in different domains. In the working model of blockchain, one party initiates the transaction by creating a block.

Even though BCT gained momentum in the future Internet systems, number of challenges are to be addressed carefully. Expertise in BCT technology is much needed since we are in nasal stage of this technology. An adoption of BCT offers promising features in various domains, but huge initial cost for the infrastructure is a major concern for the industries. Privacy and security factors also play an important role for the implementation of BCT. Scalability and legal regulations are also posing a major challenge for the adoption of BCT.</td>

      <td>Verification of smart contracts: A survey</td>
      <td>AbstractTo achieve trust and continuity in the smart contracts-based business process execution, the verification of such smart contracts is mandatory. A blockchain-based smart contract should work as intended before using it. Due to the immutable nature of blockchain, any bugs or errors will become permanent once published and could lead to huge economic losses. To avoid such problems, verification is required to check the correctness and the security of the smart contract. In this survey, we consider the smart contracts and we investigate smart contacts formal verification methods. We also investigate the security assurance for smart contracts using vulnerabilities detection methods. In this context, we provide a detailed overview of the different approaches to verify the smart contracts and we present the used methods and tools. We show a description of each method as well as its advantages and limitations and we draw several conclusions.</td>

      <td>Blockchains, Cryptocurrency, and Smart Contracts Technology: Security Considerations</td>
      <td>Blockchain was originally block chain, a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked data blocks and secured using cryptography. Today’s block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data, and it is represented as a Merkle tree. Transaction data consists of transactions. The data from each block hashes into a unique cryptographic number—a hash—as it links onto the next block. The unique number or hash makes each block on the blockchain immutable. This means a block of data on the blockchain can never be changed again. Thus, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data. The blockchain is stored in a distributed peer-to-peer network of servers, and any transaction, between any two or more parties, that uses the data in any of these blocks must be approved by a majority of all network servers using efficiently verifiable protocols. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the network majority. This last feature of decentralized consensus, possessed by the blockchain technology, gives it broad appeal in a variety of areas requiring recording of events such as medical records, all types of records management activities, such as identity management, transaction processing, documenting provenance, food traceability or voting . In this chapter, we discuss all these applications, security issues, and the future of blockchain technology.</td>

      <td>Smart contracts are seen as the major building blocks for future autonomous blockchain- and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)-based applications. Engineering such contracts for trustless, append-only, and decentralized digital ledgers allows mutually distrustful parties to transform legal requirements into immutable and formalized rules. Previous experience shows this to be a challenging task due to demanding socio-technical ecosystems and the specificities of decentralized ledger technology. In this paper, we therefore develop an integrated process model for engineering DLT-based smart contracts that accounts for the specificities of DLT. This model was iteratively refined with the support of industry experts. The model explicitly accounts for the immutability of the trustless, append-only, and decentralized DLT ecosystem, and thereby overcomes certain limitations of traditional software engineering process models. More specifically, it consists of five successive and closely intertwined phases: conceptualization, implementation, approval, execution, and finalization. For each phase, the respective activities, roles, and artifacts are identified and discussed in detail. Applying such a model when engineering smart contracts will help software engineers and developers to better understand and streamline the engineering process of DLTs in general and blockchain in particular. Furthermore, this model serves as a generic framework which will support application development in all fields in which DLT can be applied.</td>

In this study, we conduct a PRISMA guided systematic review of blockchain research in the business literature from 2014 to 2018. Our results show a rapid increase of studies over the five year period. The findings also convey key insights about the current state of scholarly investigation on blockchain, including its top benefits and challenges for business and society. We found that blockchain remains an early-stage domain of research in terms of theoretical grounding, methodological diversity, and empirically grounded work. We suggest research directions to improve our understanding of the state of blockchain and advance future research of this increasingly important and expansive area.</td>

The rich applications and semantics of DApps inevitably introduce many security vulnerabilities, which have no counterparts in pure cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin. Since Ethereum is a new, yet complex, system, it is imperative to have a systematic and comprehensive understanding on its security from a holistic perspective, which was previously unavailable in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, the present survey, which can also be used as a tutorial, fills this void.

Its decentralized feature has a broad application prospect, but still faces scalability problem. Currently, blockchain scalability bottleneck is mainly in three aspects: performance inefficiency, high confirmation delay, and function extension. For example, Bitcoin can only deal with 7 transactions per second averagely. Obviously, it cannot meet the requirement of current digital payment scenarios, nor can it be carried in other applications such as distributed storage and credit service. What's more, different blockchain systems carry different business and requirements, so scalability is the core issue of the current development of blockchain. This paper introduces the blockchain scalability related technologies from the aspects of improving efficiency and extending functionality of blockchain system, respectively.

At the same time, the use of wearable and mobile devices may also become a part of eCommerce blockchain operation, especially during the on-charge time. The paper considers the possibility of using a large number of constrained devices to support the operation of the blockchain with a low impact on battery consumption. The utilization of such devices is expected to improve the system efficiency as well as to attract a more substantial number of users. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge with a survey of the main applications of blockchain for smartphones along with existing mobile blockchain projects.

The system was deployed in a worldwide testnet with more than two thousand smartphones and compared with other projects from the user-experienced metrics perspective. The results prove that the utilization of PoA systems on a smartphone does not significantly affect the lifetime of the smartphone battery while existing methods based on PoW have a tremendous negative impact.

      <td>Due to the proliferation of ICT during the last few decades, there is an exponential increase in the usage of various smart applications such as smart farming, smart healthcare, supply-chain &amp; logistics, business, tourism and hospitality, energy management etc. However, for all the aforementioned applications, security and privacy are major concerns keeping in view of the usage of the open channel, i.e., Internet for data transfer. Although many security solutions and standards have been proposed over the years to enhance the security levels of aforementioned smart applications, but the existing solutions are either based upon the centralized architecture (having single point of failure) or having high computation and communication costs. Moreover, most of the existing security solutions have focussed only on few aspects and fail to address scalability, robustness, data storage, network latency, auditability, immutability, and traceability. To handle the aforementioned issues, blockchain technology can be one of the solutions. Motivated from these facts, in this paper, we present a systematic review of various blockchain-based solutions and their applicability in various Industry 4.0-based applications. Our contributions in this paper are in four fold. Firstly, we explored the current state-of-the-art solutions in the blockchain technology for the smart applications. Then, we illustrated the reference architecture used for the blockchain applicability in various Industry 4.0 applications. Then, merits and demerits of the traditional security solutions are also discussed in comparison to their countermeasures. Finally, we provided a comparison of existing blockchain-based security solutions using various parameters to provide deep insights to the readers about its applicability in various applications.</td>

      <td>Blockchain, a form of distributed ledger technology has attracted the interests of stakeholders across several sectors including healthcare. Its' potential in the multi-stakeholder operated sector like health has been responsible for several investments, studies, and implementations. Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems traditionally used for the exchange of health information amongst healthcare stakeholders have been criticised for centralising power, failures and attack-points with exchange data custodians. EHRs have struggled in the face of multi-stakeholder and system requirements while adhering to security, privacy, ethical and other regulatory constraints. Blockchain is promising amongst others to address the many EHR challenges, primarily trustless and secure exchange of health information amongst stakeholders. Many blockchain-in-healthcare frameworks have been proposed; some prototyped and/or implemented. This study leveraged the PRISMA framework to systematically search and evaluate the different models proposed; prototyped and/or implemented. The bibliometric and functional distribution of all 143 articles from this study were presented. This study evaluated 61 articles that discussed either prototypes or pilot or implementations. The technical and architectural analysis of these 61 articles for privacy, security, cost, and performance were detailed. Blockchain was found to solve the trust, security and privacy constraints of traditional EHRs often at significant performance, storage and cost trade-offs.</td>

This paper outlines the existing solutions to blockchain scalability, which can be classified into two categories: \n&lt;italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;first layer&lt;/italic&gt;\n and \n&lt;italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;second layer solutions&lt;/italic&gt;\n. First layer solutions propose modifications to the blockchain (i.e., changing the blockchain structure, such as block size) while second layer solutions propose mechanisms that are implemented outside of the blockchain. In particular, we focus on sharding as a promising first layer solution to the scalability issue; the basic idea behind sharding is to divide the blockchain network into multiple committees, each processing a separate set of transactions. More specifically, (a) we propose a taxonomy based on committee formation and intra-committee consensus; and (b) we compare the main existing sharding-based blockchain protocols. We also present a performance-based comparative analysis (i.e., throughput and latency), of the advantages, and disadvantages in existing scalability solutions.</td>

SDN aims to efficiently transform network architecture and operations to be agile, and effectively enrich the functionality of underlying network elements, such as routers and switches, by decoupling the control plane from the data plane. In SDN, the network intelligence is centralized in a software entity so-called SDN controller, which enables network administrators to dynamically manage, secure, and optimize network resources and programmatically shape all entire network traffic pattern. Despite the impressive benefits SDN has brought to network architecture, it introduces new security challenges and prompts different implementation strategies to spread attack vectors. This paper comprehensively describes the utilization of Blockchain technology to secure and protect SDN architecture and discusses the feasibility of integrating the revolutionary technologies of SDN and Blockchain to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability to network infrastructure.</td>

However, 5G marks a radical shift from this focus as 5G and beyond networks are being designed to be future-proof by catering to diverse requirements of several use cases. These requirements include Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications, Massive Machine-Type Communications and Enhanced Mobile Broadband. To realize such features in 5G and beyond, there is a need to rethink how current cellular networks are deployed because designing new radio access technologies and utilizing the new spectrum are not enough. Several technologies, such as software-defined networking, network function virtualization, machine learning and cloud computing, are being integrated into the 5G networks to fulfil the need for diverse requirements. These technologies, however, give rise to several challenges associated with decentralization, transparency, interoperability, privacy and security. To address these issues, Blockchain has emerged as a potential solution due to its capabilities such as transparency, data encryption, auditability, immutability and distributed architecture. In this paper, we review the state-of-art application of Blockchain in 5G network and explore how it can facilitate enabling technologies of 5G and beyond to enable various services at the front-haul, edge and the core.

Blockchain platforms like Bitcoin are public, open, and permission-less. They are also decentralized, immutable, and append-only ledger; those ledgers can store any type of data and are shared among all the participants of the network. These platforms provide a high degree of anonymity for their users' identity and full transparency of the activities recorded on the ledger while simultaneously ensuring data security and tamper-resistance. All nodes on the network collectively work to validate the same set of data and to achieve group consensus. Blockchain platforms like Ethereum have the ability to develop smart contracts and embed business logic. This allows the use of blockchain beyond cryptocurrency as a business management solution. Besides the issues of scalability and the expensive nature of most blockchain systems, many attributes of traditional public blockchain are not desirable in a business or enterprise context such as anonymity, full transparency, and permissionless. Permissioned blockchain platforms like Hyperledger Fabric are designed and built with enterprise and business in mind, retaining the desirable qualities of blockchain for enterprise while replacing the qualities of blockchain that are undesirable for the enterprise.

Basically Blockchain is a distributed immutable ledgerutilized by user mainly to perform transactions across various nodes in a blockchain network after a mutual consensus of all the associated nodes in the network. Noticeably, Blockchain is made famous by the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. As of 2017 Blockchain has seen to disrupt many applications to a global worth of 150B. The consensus models are responsible for the process of reaching an agreement between all nodes in blockchain to accept a new block. The consensus model plays a vital role in sustaining Blockchain efficiency. Using the right consensus model can significantly increase the performance of blockchain operation. The consensus models can be divided into two categories. The first category is the proof-based consensus model whereby a node in the Blockchain performs enough proof over other nodes to gain a chance to append the next block to the chain. The second category is the voting-based model in which nodes need to share their results in verifying a transaction of a new block before a final decision is reached. In this paper we discuss the characteristics of some major existing consensus models and provide some critical reviews on their performances. The reviewis mainly concerning these aspects: transaction throughput, latency, network bandwidth, and storage.</td>

Meanwhile, eight threats of blockchain were categorised into three groups: organisational threats (installation and transaction costs, interoperability issues, and lack of technical skills), social threats (social acceptance and regulations issues), and technological threats (scalability issues, authorisation and security issues, high energy consumption, and slow processing speeds).ConclusionBlockchain is a viable technology that can improve the healthcare data sharing and storing system owing to its decentralisation, immutability, transparency and traceability features. However, many healthcare organisations remain hesitant to adopt blockchain technology due to threats such as security and authorisation issues, interoperability issues and lack of technical skills related to blockchain technology.</td>

Blockchain technology has the promise to change all existing business models and make financial services cheaper contributing therefore to a better financial inclusion and, even a better economic wealth distribution. Numerous studies optimistically praise such potential societal benefits by listing all processes that could be optimized through this technology. However, the picture is not necessary all bright. Blockchain can indeed disrupt and significantly improve our societies but there still exist some societal costs in the way this technology is implemented. This paper provides a perspective overviewing of the current trends related to the development of the most widely used implementation of blockchain technology based on the proof-of-work consensus algorithm. These trends will be discussed in three steps: the ‘Good Blockchain’ overviews how this technology can improve our societies; the ‘Bad blockchain’ offers a more nuanced perspective by discussing the potential polluting activities generated by some mining activities. Finally, the ‘Ugly blockchain’ investigates how this technology might generate a risk of concentration in the mining industry affecting therefore the nature and even the existence of the blockchain technology.</td>

Traditional Internet of Things (IoT) traceability systems provide the feasible solutions for the quality monitoring and traceability of food supply chains. However, most of the IoT solutions rely on the centralized server-client paradigm that makes it difficult for consumers to acquire all transaction information and to track the origins of products. Blockchain is a cutting-edge technology that has great potential for improving traceability performance by providing security and full transparency. However, the benefits, challenges and development methods of blockchain-based food traceability systems are not yet fully explored in the current literature. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to review the blockchain technology characteristics and functionalities, identify blockchain-based solutions for addressing food traceability concerns, highlight the benefits and challenges of blockchain-based traceability systems implementation, and help researchers and practitioners to apply blockchain technology based food traceability systems by proposing an architecture design framework and suitability application analysis flowchart of blockchain based food traceability systems. The results of this study contribute to better understanding and knowledge on how to improve the food traceability by developing and implementing blockchain-based traceability systems. The paper provides valuable information for researchers and practitioners on the use of blockchain-based food traceability management and has a positive effect on the improvement of food sustainability.</td>

IoE uses Internet to collect, organize, optimize and manage the networks energy information from different edge devices in order to develop a distributed smart energy infrastructure. Sensors and communication technologies are used to collect data and to predict demand and supply by consumers and suppliers respectively. However, with the development of renewable energy resources, Electric Vehicles (EVs), smart grid and Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, the existing energy sector started shifting towards distributed and decentralized solutions. Moreover, the security and privacy issues because of centralization is another major concern for IoE technology. In this context, Blockchain technology with the features of automation, immutability, public ledger facility, irreversibility, decentralization, consensus and security has been adopted in the literature for solving the prevailing problems of centralized IoE architecture. By leveraging smart contracts, blockchain technology enables automated data exchange, complex energy transactions, demand response management and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading etc. Blockchain will play vital role in the evolution of the IoE market as distributed renewable resources and smart grid network are being deployed and used. We discuss the potential and applications of blockchain in the IoE field. This article is build on the literature research and it provides insight to the end-user regarding the future IoE scenario in the context of blockchain technology.

The regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US had earlier limited the usage of UAVs to military applications. However more recently, the FAA has outlined new enforcement that will also expand the usage of UAVs in civilian and commercial applications. Due to being deployed in open atmosphere, UAVs are vulnerable to being lost, destroyed or physically hijacked. With the UAV technology becoming ubiquitous, various issues in UAV networks such as intra-UAV communication, UAV security, air data security, data storage and management, etc. need to be addressed. Blockchain being a distributed ledger protects the shared data using cryptography techniques such as hash functions and public key encryption. It can also be used for assuring the truthfulness of the information stored and for improving the security and transparency of the UAVs. In this paper, we review various applications of blockchain in UAV networks such as network security, decentralized storage, inventory management, surveillance, etc., and discuss some broader perspectives in this regard.

By leveraging these benefits, automation is brought about in the industries giving rise to the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). IoT is prone to several cyberattacks and needs challenging approaches to achieve the desired security. Moreover, with the emergence of IIoT, the security vulnerabilities posed by it are even more devastating. Therefore, in order to provide a guideline to researchers, this survey primarily attempts to classify the attacks based on the objects of vulnerability. Subsequently, each of the individual attacks is mapped to one or more layers of the generalized IoT/IIoT architecture followed by a discussion on the countermeasures proposed in literature. Some relevant real-life attacks for each of these categories are also discussed. We further discuss the countermeasures proposed for the most relevant security threats in IIoT. A case study on two of the most important industrial IoT applications is also highlighted. Next, we explore the challenges brought by the centralized IoT/IIoT architecture and how blockchain can effectively be used towards addressing such challenges. In this context, we also discuss in detail one IoT specific Blockchain design known as Tangle, its merits and demerits. We further highlight the most relevant Blockchain-based solutions provided in recent times to counter the challenges posed by the traditional cloud-centered applications. The blockchain-related solutions provided in the context of two of the most relevant applications for each of IoT and IIoT is also discussed. Subsequently, we design a taxonomy of the security research areas in IoT/IIoT along with their corresponding solutions. Finally, several open research directions relevant to the focus of this survey are identified.</td>

Traditional approaches are no longer capable of addressing the demand for trust and transparency in these applications. Hence, the current decade is demanding intelligent systems to be autonomous, and in particular explainable, transparent, and trustworthy. To satisfy such requirements, and therefore to comply with the recent EU regulations in the matter (e.g., GDPR), intelligent systems (e.g., Multi-Agent Systems - MAS) and technologies enabling tamper-proof and distributed consensus (e.g., Blockchain Technology - BCT) are conveying into reconciling solutions. Recently, the empowerment of MAS with BCT (and the use of BCT themselves) has gained considerable momentum, raising challenges, and unveiling opportunities. However, several ethical concerns have yet to be faced. This paper elaborates on the entanglement among ethical and technological challenges while proposing and discussing approaches that address these emerging research opportunities.</td>

Blockchain platforms are currently being used across the world in several government processes and business domains, for their unique characteristics. Even though blockchain shows potentials in its ability to provide a limitless number of inventive commercial trading, payments, government, healthcare, military and other critical applications, they face a security weakness on their recent prominent breaches of exchanges. Hence, there remain major security issues that are essential to be overcome before blockchain adopts the mainstream. And currently, this technology relies on hardware security modules (HSM) for the management and protection of their digital keys. The HSM generates key pairs, has secure storage and can off-load cryptographic operations from the entire system. But recently, FPGAs are preferred for hardware realization of algorithms considering its flexibility, low cost and long-term maintenance. It also has an advantage of reconfigurable or reprogrammable hardware design whenever new security or adaptation of an algorithm is required to support higher security levels. The paper presents a review of hardware security modules and proposed to enhance the scalability and reliability of the HSM by implementing it with the silicon-based secure module. Integrating PUF technology into the chip for storing and securing encryption or private keys, its security level can also be improved.</td>

      <td>Today, supply chain finance is a very important topic. Traditional supply chains rely on banks to support the related financing activities and services. With the emergence of blockchain technology, more and more companies in different industries have considered using it to support supply chain finance. In this paper, we study supply chain financing problems in supply chains selling fashionable products. Modeling under the standard newsvendor problem setting with a single manufacturer and a single retailer employing a revenue sharing contract, we develop analytical models for both the traditional and blockchain-supported supply chains. We derive the optimal contracting and quantity decisions in each supply chain with Nash bargaining between the manufacturer and retailer. We analytically show how the revenue sharing contract can coordinate both types of supply chains. We then compare the optimal systems performances between the two supply chains. We prove that the blockchain-supported supply chain incurs a lower level of operational risk than the traditional supply chain. We have shown that if the service fees by banks are sufficiently high, adopting blockchain technology is a mean-risk dominating policy which brings a higher expected profit and a lower risk for the supply chain and its members. For robustness checking, we examine other commonly seen supply chain contracts and alternative risk measures, and analytically reveal that the results remain valid.</td>

      <td>The problem of fraud identity documents is a fatal problem. This severity is due to the method currently being employed to create and authenticate legitimate documents. Creation of identity document requires an individual to convince appropriate government authority by producing all supporting proofs of identity declaration. This process is vulnerable as it can result in the accumulation of power to the individual issuing the identity document. Also, the authentication process involves sharing the copy of already issued identity proof. Many a time, identity proofs are shared with individuals who cannot be trusted for their integrity. This can result in misuse of the identity documents for socially evil activities. Blockchain provides a decentralized trust-less network which nobody owns, but everyone can use. The proposed system provides solution to the identity management problem by putting personal identifiers on blockchain. Using blockchain technology, a system has been proposed to create, manage and confirm an individual’s identity and credentials in a much secure way. Sharing of relevant information would be possible only with the identity owner’s will. Hence, creation of false identity documents will be prevented.</td>

It’s true that blockchain has its roots in cryptocurrency applications and is still evolving for that purpose in the financial sector, but many other organisations across different industries are beginning to see the non-crypto use cases where this mechanism to record data that cannot be changed or reversed or apply as smart contracts (as a way to time-stamp transactions between parties) is becoming extremely relevant and purposeful. A variety of industry sectors, besides Finance, has undertaken the use of these distributed technologies and beneficial attributes of blockchain from the healthcare and pharmaceutical, real estate, retail and supply chain, legal and publishing. Organisations have flexible options to run blockchain as permissionless (anyone can join), permissioned (where those need to be invited) or hybrid (a consortium type) and whether data should be held on-chain or off-chain. With industry entering its fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) the addition of blockchain as a complimentary technology has its place and there are some industries very suited to the significant impact it may bring. Also, the advances of Internet of Things, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence has meant more pressures on potential impacts to data and the ripple effects that cyber-attacks may cause. This has also become complicated, as cyber-attacks have become much more sophisticated over recent years with the different configuration types and various industry sectors have suffered from a range of these different attack vectors, resulting in some devastating outcomes. These have manifested in the shape of ransomware, malware, manipulation methods, phishing and spear-phishing. Whilst data breaches are a serious incident, in most organisations, there is a growing concern regarding attacks that are designed to have a more destructive effect such as the Ukraine cyber-attack in 2015 that resulted in a shutdown of the power grid or the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017 that caused widespread chaos with healthcare institutions unable to carry out any tasks since access to data/systems was unavailable.</td>

It inspires us to introduce new steganography in Blockchain in order to overcome the aforementioned problem since an attacker cannot tamper Blockchain data once a block was generated, meaning that, a receiver will always be able to fully retrieve the secret data with the secret key. For the proposed work, the miner serves as the steganographer, who embeds secret data into the transactions within a block during the process of generating the block. To secure the data embedding process within a block, we choose a part of transactions in a block according to a secret key, and embed the secret data by repeatable-address arrangement. Our analysis demonstrates that, it is difficult for an attacker to extract the embedded data. Since the miner collects normal transactions for generating a block and does not generate abnormal transactions, the data embedding process will not arouse suspicion, providing a high level of security.\n</td>

      <td>A Survey on Privacy Concerns in Blockchain Applications and Current Blockchain Solutions to Preserve Data Privacy</td>
      <td>Due to the offering of many benefits, blockchain is a useful environment to build many applications in multiple fields such as cryptocurrency, Internet of Things (IoT), mobile applications and healthcare industry. However, it has a problem in ensuring the privacy of user data due to its public nature. Data on a blockchain is public and can reveal someone’s personal data or transactions. Many applications that venture in blockchain such as financial applications, Internet of Things (IoT) and healthcare applications can fall victim to revelation of personal data and linking attack. Many solutions such as automated access-control protocol that does not require a third party, a local miner operating in a local private blockchain that enforces users’ access control policy, a cryptographic protocol that lets contractual parties interact by using zero-knowledge proof, and computation of data query in a distributed way by using secure multi-party computation have been proposed to tackle this privacy issue in using blockchain. Hence, this paper provides a review on the current solutions that addresses the privacy issues of blockchain in different platforms. However, these solutions have some limitations that cannot be overlooked and proper measures must be taken to make blockchain to be able to better protect the privacy of its users. This paper also discusses the limitations of the solutions and looks into the aspects that need to be addressed.</td>

Major advantages of using blockchain technology includes reducing transaction costs, preventing data forgery and alteration, and further flexibility. The construction industry is generally considered as an industry that has great potentials for blockchain technology utilization mainly due to the high volume of transactions among various entities. Despite the perceived positive impact, there have been few cases of blockchain applications within the construction industry. This study is conducted with an aim of finding ways to apply blockchain technology to the construction industry. In order to identify potential application areas, construction lifecycle and project management knowledge areas are used in developing a survey questionnaire. Data collected from the survey is analyzed by employing importance performance analysis (IPA) method considering both applicability of the technology and anticipated impact from utilizing the technology. In relation to the construction project lifecycle, ‘Project Cost/Change Management’, ‘Contract Bidding and Formation’, and ‘Procurement Evaluation’ are emerged as top three candidates for blockchain application with high applicability and impact. Regarding the knowledge area, ‘Procurement Management’ and ‘Cost Management’ are identified as the main blockchain application areas with high applicability and impact. All the identified specific construction tasks with high applicability and impact are related to ‘Procurement’, ‘Contract’, and ‘Cost’. Therefore, it is reasonable to start focusing blockchain convergence efforts these areas and then expand them as the technology matures.</td>

      <td>An exploratory study of smart contracts in the Ethereum blockchain platform</td>
      <td>Ethereum is a blockchain platform that supports smart contracts. Smart contracts are pieces of code that perform general-purpose computations. For instance, smart contracts have been used to implement crowdfunding initiatives that raised a total of US$6.2 billion from January to June of 2018. In this paper, we conduct an exploratory study of smart contracts. Differently from prior studies that focused on particular aspects of a subset of smart contracts, our goal is to have a broader understanding of all contracts that are currently deployed in Ethereum. In particular, we elucidate how frequently used the contracts are (activity level), what they do (category), and how complex they are (source code complexity). To conduct this study, we mined and cross-linked data from four sources: Ethereum dataset on the Google BigQuery platform, Etherscan, State of the DApps, and CoinMarketCap. Our study period runs from July 2015 (inception of Ethereum) until September 2018. With regards to activity level, we notice that it is concentrated on a very small subset of the contracts. More specifically, only 0.05% of the smart contracts are the target of 80% of the transactions that are sent to contracts. New solutions to cope with Ethereum’s limited scalability should take such an activity imbalance into consideration. With regards to categories, we highlight that the new and widely advertised rich programming model of smart contracts is currently being used to develop very simple applications that tend to be token-centric (e.g., ICOs, Crowdsales, etc). Finally, with regards to code complexity, we observe that the source code of high-activity verified contracts is small, with at most 211 instructions in 80% of the cases. These contracts also commonly include at least two subcontracts and libraries in their source code. The comment ratio of these contracts is also significantly higher than that of GitHub top-starred projects written in Java, C++, and C#. Hence, the source code of high-activity verified smart contracts exhibit particular complexity characteristics compared to other popular programming languages. Further studies are necessary to uncover the actual reasons behind such differences. Finally, based on our findings, we propose an open research agenda to drive and foster future studies in the area.</td>

      <td>Blockchain is a distributed data store that offers a trusted infrastructure for mutually distrusting parties to network and transact, eliminating the need of any central authority or third party intermediary. The trust element in blockchain is due to the tamper proof record keeping in blockchain through efficient hashed block-linking mechanism and the consensus protocol among the network peers to create any new record in the distributed ledger. The consensus mechanism in distributed data store ensures that every participant node in the network accepts on a common agreement over a transaction or state transition in a system by gathering confirmation from all or at-least majority of the members. Usually some form of voting or lottery mechanism is employed for the leader election process to implement consensus among the participants in a business network. Consensus mechanism is also responsible for the smooth functioning of the distributed network in the event of some arbitrary faults or node failures or even any malicious attacks in the network. Generally a consensus mechanism implementation is a tailored solution based on application or use case. It ensures the correctness of data in the trusted distributed ledger through the peer agreement process.

Moreover, the electoral process in many countries is characterized by massive rigging, high cost of electoral materials, and declaration of false results. In this paper, we will present a review of the blockchain Technology and some of the potential roles to play in conducting a transparent election. This paper opines that with the emergence of the blockchain technology, African Nations should tap from it and build a reliable, secure, and convenient electoral voting system. It further suggests that a blockchain electoral voting system will eliminate most of the challenges faced by African nations in conducting a free, fair and transparent election with low cost and total security. The issue of election rigging is almost completely eradicated with this technology (if properly installed). An attempt to alter/manipulate records (votes) in the system’s database can be spotted easily, because of its rigorous consensus rules, such an attempt is considered void and denied permission to access, alter, or destroy any of the previously saved votes. However, the paper argues that there are institutional challenges to implementing this technology within the continent. Specifically, there is a need to educate the masses as well as create robust policies that can accommodate this technology within the continent. Failure to acknowledge these challenges may well prevent the application of blockchain technology in African electoral process in the foreseeable future.</td>

      <td>One of the building blocks of our legal and economic systems in society is the indispensable reliance on contracts and trust systems to protect individual rights. Recently smart contracts are becoming prominent parts of various blockchain platforms. The goal of smart contracts is to eliminate the third party and centralized trust systems. Due to recent emergence of smart contracts, there is no well-defined framework that researchers can use to evaluate smart contracts under various blockchain platforms and differentiate between them. In this work, a survey on the prominent smart contract landscape specially those based on blockchain have been conducted. Based on the survey, an evaluation framework to assess smart contracts has been proposed. The framework is a set of criteria based on two major aspects; infrastructure related and development related criteria. The evaluation framework was peer-reviewed for reliability and validity. To measure the applicability of the proposed framework, it has been used to empirically evaluate some of the most prominent smart contract platforms. The results of the empirical evaluation have shown that the Ethereum blockchain smart contract exceeds the others in terms of development tools, resources, and community support. EOS blockchain smart contracts have the best execution speeds, and transaction costs. Lastly, Stellar blockchain has predictability and the best transaction builder to use in smart contract development concerning user friendliness. Recommendations for smart contract developers are provided in light of the research.</td>

The two major branches of modern accounting, financial accounting and management accounting, have become disconnected in practice. Both of them need to rely on different information processing systems for their actual operation. This is not economical for the enterprise, and it is also not conducive to management accounting to play its function of serving the economic management of the enterprise. To this end, the in-depth analysis of the differences between management accounting and financial accounting, and the introduction of “enterprise economic value added”, the unification of the theoretical differences between the two is of great significance to the development of the accounting field. This paper introduces the current research status of accounting information distortion and accounting fraud through the review and analysis of domestic and foreign literatures.

      <td>In the past years numerous scandals in hiring processes of public institutions revealed significant weaknesses of the existing process. This lead to a lose of trust of citizens and applicants in these processes. Besides that, even honest processes often lack transparency for applicants, the company and, in the case of public institutions, also for citizens. Distributed ledger technology has been used in numerous past projects to establish trust between entities. Especially smart contracts have been a useful tool to execute programs in this setting. Thus, in the context of this project we developed an approach based on smart contracts to decentralize this process and improve its transparency and reliability. We enhance the system with game theory mechanics to encourage reviewers and candidates to participate honestly, further increasing the likelihood of a fair selection process. Nonetheless, not all blockchains support smart contracts and their usage comes with an elevated additional monetary cost. Due to that, in the blockchain environment, many businesses only emulate smart contracts by executing them on external servers which improves the scalability but decreases the decentralization. In the context of this, we compare the advantages and disadvantages of emulating smart contracts compared to native smart contracts in our concrete usage example. Our approach, compared to existing solutions, can be employed on any distributed ledger which allows to store some sort of metadata on the chain resulting in a significantly lower creation and maintenance cost (up to 30 times cheaper). The developed solution and discussion gives useful insight into safety and cost considerations which have to be made when deciding between native and emulated smart contracts.</td>

Unfortunately, most patients do not have access to their complete health information as they are stored across the various institutions that they have visited over their lifetime. The purpose of this paper is to report on an investigation into developing a mobile system for patient-centered healthcare using blockchain technology. A design science research approach was used to design, develop and evaluate a prototype that implemented a three-tier architecture using blockchain. Formative evaluations of the prototype revealed that the system could successfully support patient-managed healthcare. The implications of this project would be changing the way patients and healthcare practitioners interact with each other by improving the quality of clinical encounters by allowing patients access to their health information, sharing the information with healthcare practitioners and both parties collaborating in the development of a treatment plan.</td>

      <td>Blockchain Technology in Footwear Supply Chain</td>
      <td>This research investigated how adopting blockchain technology will strategically place footwear companies in a competitive market. The article attempted to answer three central research questions: (1) Should a footwear company adopt blockchain technology in its supply chain? (2) What can footwear companies gain from the adoption? (3) Where can the blockchain position the footwear companies in the competitive market if the implementation of the technology is in the supply chain? First, we explored the business model and the features of the footwear industry and examined the blockchain technology, which provided the information from the characteristics of the industry and the advantages of the technology as the inputs of the TOWS matrix. Next, the author highlighted what benefits the footwear companies could get from the adoption of the technology based on the TOWS matrix analysis. Also, the author analyzed where the blockchain would position the company if the adoption of the technology is in the supply chain by investigating the definition and characteristics of the disruptive technology and Roger’s diffusion of innovations theory. Finally, the author concluded that technology still holds for promise though the implementation of the technology has several barriers and challenges, given the potential of the technology. In terms of the scope of this research, this chapter focused on catering to the needs of footwear giants (i.e., Nike, Adidas) due to their urgent needs of creating a transparent and traceable supply chain.</td>

First, a cloud-based public key infrastructure (PKI) utilizing blockchain technology model is described. Enhancements over past models include the use of blockchains to establish persistent access to certificate data and certificate revocation lists. By completely decoupling the certificate authority portion of a PKI and storing certificate data inside smart contracts, the proposed method yields a sizable performance boost while decreasing the attack surface. Second, we propose a dynamic runtime sharding of Tendermint, which is an in-development state machine replication algorithm that uses the blockchain model to provide Byzantine-fault tolerance. We call this variation Randition. We incorporate recent research from blockchain consensus and replicated state machine partitioning to allow Randition users to shard their blockchain, which has greatly improved write performance at a slight cost of some Byzantine fault tolerance.</td>

But although blockchain is often seen as a strategic technology, research focusing on its impact on business models is still rare. This research derives a hypotheses model that connects IT innovations with the three generic value disciplines of banks “operational excellence”, “customer intimacy” and “product leadership” as well as the four generic elements of business models “what”, “who”, “how” and “value”. A business model acts as a mediator for IT innovation. To test the hypothesis model data provided from an international survey of 104 financial services institutions and start-up companies was applied. The results support the hypothesis that all three value disciplines might be impacted by blockchain technology in the future. The regression analysis reveals that especially banks’ operations could be significantly changed. With these results, this research contributes to the emerging literature on blockchain and business models and the strategic use of IT.</td>

      <td>The blockchain technology emerged in 2008 as a distributed peer to peer network structure, capable of ensuring security for transactions made using the Bitcoin digital currency, without the need for third party intermediaries to validate them. Although its beginning was linked to cryptocurrencies, its use has diversified over the recent years. There are various projects using the blockchain technology to perform document validation, electronic voting, tokenization of non-perishable goods, and many others. With its increasing use, concern arises with possible attacks that could threaten the integrity of the consensus of the chain. One of the well-known attacks to the blockchain consensus mechanism is the selfish mining attack, in which malicious nodes can deflect their behavior from the standard pattern by not immediately disclosing their newly mined blocks. This malicious behavior can result in a disproportionate share of rewards for those nodes, especially if they have a significant processing power. The goal of this paper is to present a simple heuristic to detect the presence of selfish mining attack (and variants) in blockchain networks that use the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm. The proposal is to signal when the blockchain fork height deviates from the standard, indicating when the network is under the influence of such attacks.</td>

      <td>This study is aimed at covering the application of blockchain technology (BCT) in the Indian banking sector and its benefits in banking operations. This paper covers the challenges it faces in implementing blockchain technology. The paper highlights how BCT is addressing key issues such as speedily and securely transmission of data, value to and from various transaction partners, cost of processing payments, new products, and services creation. The paper also covers various advantages brought out by BCT such as automate verification process and eliminating the need for multiple parties to confirm manual validity of transactions. With the advent of BCT, India’s banking and financial systems can be expected to transform the banking process to a new level. This study covers the field investigation as to how existing BCT is helping banks to effectively and efficiently monitor and control the banking process. The respondents were leading banking institutions and FinTech firms in the country. The study result shows that some of the Indian banks have already started their journey in using BCT and they got the benefits. However, they are facing certain challenges in the adaptation and implementation of this new technology. The legal and standardization issues need to be looked into with regards to jurisdictions in cross border transactions and interoperability between different BCT systems. Banks are currently using permission based BCT solutions for very defined (small) eco-system because of the data security reasons. It is like but not exactly the ‘WhatsApp’ group system wherein an administrator decides on membership of the group. However, for each bank, the considerations will differ for the ecosystem required to deploy the BCT solution. The study covers only leading banks and FinTech companies in the country and smaller players in the banking sector. In India financial institutions are at various stages of BCT adoption. They have already seen the benefits of BCT in some processes where BCT is put into use. With time to come with full implementation, BCT will change the picture of banking in India. With BCT the banking processes will be more transparent, faster and cost-effective with elimination of intermediaries. The key benefits will be decentralisation, trust, and security in transactions.</td>

      <td>Potential and limits of Blockchain technology for networked businesses</td>
      <td>New ways to organize economic activities are emerging, facilitated by Blockchain technology or the broader term Distributed Ledger Technology. Blockchains consist of dynamic shared ledgers that can be applied to ensure transparency and traceability and to save time when recording transactions between parties, remove costs associated with intermediaries (or, according to Nakamoto (2008), remove the need for intermediaries altogether), while enabling the introduction of pseudonymous parties on the Internet. First, and probably the most known application of blockchain technology, is cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin. It has taken businesses and industries some time to recognize that the underlying technology of Bitcoin could be the next wave for disruption of their existing business models. All too often, the focus of the media coverage is on the connection of cyber-currencies to criminal activities or on the highly speculative nature of their exchange rates and issues with coin exchanges.In this Special Issue, we qualify this disruptive potential, as we recognize that Blockchain technology has much broader and deeper applications than “just” currencies. We take a broad and neutral view on the technology and consider it a facilitator for new coordination mechanisms for networked businesses. The transparency of the system and the assurance that all participants will play by the rules takes the “markets versus hierarchies” discussion to the next level, when electronic markets can be created that are not governed by a single centralized entity, but rather by the community they serve and that might exist only in the virtual space – implemented as “Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)”, where “the code is the entire company” (Diedrich 2016). This might very well lead to completely different roles for current players, if not extinction.Blockchains might thus facilitate and contribute to other disruptive innovations, such as the sharing economy, the circular economy as well as smart grids that help businesses and private households to become independent in their energy provisioning. The challenge for scientists now is to distinguish between the hype and the core value of this phenomenon, to reason about and to reflect on the business potential, including the potential to disrupt trusted business models, but also to address some of the deeper technical foundations such as scalability, accountability, and security. This is the time for research to explore descriptive, explanatory and design research questions on Blockchain technology.</td>

Moreover, transaction completion time is not fixed, it can take from a few seconds to several minutes. In this paper, we include temporal constraints in smart contracts, which could mitigate the violation of time constraints, minimize the costly execution time, and avoiding thus financial penalties. To achieve this, we extend Caterpillar tool, which is the first open-source blockchain-based BPMN execution engine, to enable the automatic transformation of a large set of temporal constraints for business process model to smart contract code.

      <td>Algorithmic Analysis of Blockchain Efficiency with Communication Delay</td>
      <td>A blockchain is a distributed hierarchical data structure. Widely-used applications of blockchain include digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. This paper proposes an algorithmic approach to analyze the efficiency of a blockchain as a function of the number of blocks and the average synchronization delay. The proposed algorithms consider a random network model that characterizes the growth of a tree of blocks by adhering to a standard protocol. The model is parametric on two probability distribution functions governing block production and communication delay. Both distributions determine the synchronization efficiency of the distributed copies of the blockchain among the so- called workers and, therefore, are key for capturing the overall stochastic growth. Moreover, the algorithms consider scenarios with a fixed or an unbounded number of workers in the network. The main result illustrates how the algorithms can be used to evaluate different types of blockchain designs, e.g., systems in which the average time of block production can match the average time of message broadcasting required for synchronization. In particular, this algorithmic approach provides insight into efficiency criteria for identifying conditions under which increasing block production has a negative impact on the stability of a blockchain. The model and algorithms are agnostic of the blockchain’s final use, and they serve as a formal framework for specifying and analyzing a variety of non-functional properties of current and future blockchains.</td>

Although GitHub currently hosts more than six thousand active Blockchain software (BCS) projects, few software engineering researchers have investigated these projects and their contributors. Although the number of BCS projects is growing rapidly, the motivations, challenges, and needs of BCS developers remain a puzzle. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to understand the motivations, challenges, and needs of BCS developers and analyze the differences between BCS and non-BCS development. On this goal, we sent an online survey to 1,604 active BCS developers identified by mining the GitHub repositories of 145 popular BCS projects. The survey received 156 responses that met our criteria for analysis. The results suggest that the majority of the BCS developers are experienced in non-BCS development and are primarily motivated by the ideology of creating a decentralized financial system. Although most of the BCS projects are Open Source Software (OSS) projects by nature, more than 93% of our respondents found BCS development somewhat different from a non-BCS development as BCS projects have higher emphasis on security and reliability than most of the non-BCS projects. Other differences include: higher costs of defects, decentralized and hostile environment, technological complexity, and difficulty in upgrading the software after release. These differences were also the primary sources of challenges to them. Software development tools that are tuned for non-BCS development are inadequate for BCS and the ecosystem needs an array of new or improved tools, such as: customized IDE for BCS development tasks, debuggers for smart-contracts, testing support, easily deployable simulators, and BCS domain specific design notations.</td>

      <td>A Survey of Blockchain Frameworks and Applications</td>
      <td>The applications of the blockchain technology are still being discovered. When a new potential disruptive technology emerges, there is a tendency to try to solve every problem with that technology. However, it is still necessary to determine what approach is the best for each type of application. To find how distributed ledgers solve existing problems, this study looks for blockchain frameworks in the academic world. Identifying the existing frameworks can demonstrate where the interest in the technology exists and where it can be missing. This study encountered several blockchain frameworks in development. However, there are few references to operational needs, testing, and deploy of the technology. With the widespread use of the technology, either integrating with pre-existing solutions, replacing legacy systems, or new implementations, the need for testing, deploying, exploration, and maintenance is expected to intensify.</td>

      <td>Highlights•We conduct the first systematic examination on security risks to popular blockchain systems.•We survey the real attacks on blockchain systems and analyze related vulnerabilities exploited.•We summarize practical academic achievements for enhancing the security of blockchain.•We suggest a few future directions in the area of blockchain security.AbstractSince its inception, the blockchain technology has shown promising application prospects. From the initial cryptocurrency to the current smart contract, blockchain has been applied to many fields. Although there are some studies on the security and privacy issues of blockchain, there lacks a systematic examination on the security of blockchain systems. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study on the security threats to blockchain and survey the corresponding real attacks by examining popular blockchain systems. We also review the security enhancement solutions for blockchain, which could be used in the development of various blockchain systems, and suggest some future directions to stir research efforts into this area.</td>

      <td>An overview on smart contracts: Challenges, advances and platforms</td>
      <td>Highlights•Opportunities of smart contracts for industrial internet of things.•Lifecycle and platforms of smart contracts.•Applications of smart contracts.•Challenges and advances of smart contracts.AbstractSmart contract technology is reshaping conventional industry and business processes. Being embedded in blockchains, smart contracts enable the contractual terms of an agreement to be enforced automatically without the intervention of a trusted third party. As a result, smart contracts can cut down administration and save services costs, improve the efficiency of business processes and reduce the risks. Although smart contracts are promising to drive the new wave of innovation in business processes, there are a number of challenges to be tackled. This paper presents a survey on smart contracts. We first introduce blockchains and smart contracts. We then present the challenges in smart contracts as well as recent technical advances. We also compare typical smart contract platforms and give a categorization of smart contract applications along with some representative examples.</td>

      <td>Blockchain for 5G and beyond networks: A state of the art survey</td>
      <td>AbstractThe fifth generation (5G) wireless networks are on the way to be deployed around the world. The 5G technologies target to support diverse vertical applications by connecting heterogeneous devices and machines with drastic improvements in terms of high quality of service, increased network capacity and enhanced system throughput. However, 5G systems still remain a number of security challenges that have been mentioned by researchers and organizations, including decentralization, transparency, risks of data interoperability, and network privacy vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the conventional techniques may not be sufficient to deal with the security requirements of 5G. As 5G is generally deployed in heterogeneous networks with massive ubiquitous devices, it is quite necessary to provide secure and decentralized solutions. Motivated from these facts, in this paper we provide a state-of-the-art survey on the integration of blockchain with 5G networks and beyond. In this detailed survey, our primary focus is on the extensive discussions on the potential of blockchain for enabling key 5G technologies, including cloud computing, edge computing, Network Function Virtualization, Network Slicing, and D2D communications. We then explore and analyse the opportunities that blockchain potentially empowers important 5G services, ranging from spectrum management, data sharing, network virtualization, resource management to interference management, federated learning, privacy and security provision. The recent advances in the applications of blockchain in 5G Internet of Things are also surveyed in a wide range of popular use-case domains, such as smart healthcare, smart city, smart transportation, smart grid and UAVs. The main findings derived from the comprehensive survey on the cooperated blockchain-5G networks and services are then summarized, and possible research challenges with open issues are also identified. Lastly, we complete this survey by shedding new light on future directions of research on this newly emerging area.</td>
