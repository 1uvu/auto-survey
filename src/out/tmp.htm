      <td>Blockchain for the Internet of Things: A systematic literature review</td>
      <td>In the Internet of Things (IoT) scenario, the block-chain and, in general, Peer-to-Peer approaches could play an important role in the development of decentralized and data-intensive applications running on billion of devices, preserving the privacy of the users. Our research goal is to understand whether the blockchain and Peer-to-Peer approaches can be employed to foster a decentralized and private-by-design IoT. As a first step in our research process, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review on the blockchain to gather knowledge on the current uses of this technology and to document its current degree of integrity, anonymity and adaptability. We found 18 use cases of blockchain in the literature. Four of these use cases are explicitly designed for IoT. We also found some use cases that are designed for a private-by-design data management. We also found several issues in the integrity, anonymity and adaptability. Regarding anonymity, we found that in the blockchain only pseudonymity is guaranteed. Regarding adaptability and integrity, we discovered that the integrity of the blockchain largely depends on the high difficulty of the Proof-of-Work and on the large number of honest miners, but at the same time a difficult Proof-of-Work limits the adaptability. We documented and categorized the current uses of the blockchain, and provided a few recommendations for future work to address the above-mentioned issues.</td>

      <td>Blockchain application and outlook in the banking industry</td>
      <td>Blockchain technology is a core, underlying technology with promising application prospects in the banking industry. On one hand, the banking industry in China is facing the impact of interest rate liberalization and profit decline caused by the narrowing interest-rate spread. On the other hand, it is also affected by economic transformation, Internet development, and financial innovations. Hence, the banking industry requires urgent transformation and is seeking new growth avenues. As such, blockchains could revolutionize the underlying technology of the payment clearing and credit information systems in banks, thus upgrading and transforming them. Blockchain applications also promote the formation of “multi-center, weakly intermediated” scenarios, which will enhance the efficiency of the banking industry. However, despite the permissionless and self-governing nature of blockchains, the regulation and actual implementation of a decentralized system are problems that remain to be resolved. Therefore, we propose the urgent establishment of a “regulatory sandbox” and the development of industry standards.</td>

      <td>Equity crowdfunding via the Internet is a new channel of raising money for startups. It features low barriers to entry, low cost, and high speed, and thus encourages innovation. In recent years, equity crowdfunding in China has experienced some developments. However, some problems remain unsolved in practice. Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger technology to ensure data security, transparency, and integrity. Because it cannot be tampered with or forged, the technology is deemed to have great potential in the finance industry. This study examines current problems in the practice of equity crowdfunding in China. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of blockchain technology, this study further explores its practical applications in equity crowdfunding. 1) Blockchain technology may be a secure, efficient, low-cost solution for the registration of stocks and shares of a firm financed by crowdfunding; 2) Blockchain technology simplifies the transaction and transfer of crowdfunding equities, and thus facilitates their circulation; 3) Blockchain technology enables peer to peer transactions between investors and entrepreneurs, and solves the problems of regulatory compliance and security of fund management; Blockchain technology can be used to develop a voting system for crowdfunders, which enables them to be involved in corporate governance. This helps protect the rights and interests of small investors; 5) Blockchain technology helps regulators know about market conditions, and supports regulatory activities such as managing investors and fighting money laundering.</td>

Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) is considered to be a global consensus protocol and promises to be Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) by bringing with it the concept of quorum slices and federated byzantine fault tolerance. This consensus's working and its comparison with other protocols that were earlier proposed are analyzed here. Also, hyperledger an open-source project by Linux Foundation which includes implementing the concept of practical byzantine fault tolerance and also a platform where various other consensus protocols and blockchain applications can be deployed in a plug and play manner is also being discussed here. This paper focuses on analyzing these consensus protocols already proposed and their feasibility and efficiency in meeting the characteristics they propose to provide.</td>

A new technology, Blockchain, may be a key to addressing these challenges and should draw the attention of the whole clinical research community.Blockchain brings the Internet to its definitive decentralisation goal. The core principle of Blockchain is that any service relying on trusted third parties can be built in a transparent, decentralised, secure “trustless” manner at the top of the Blockchain (in fact, there is trust, but it is hardcoded in the Blockchain protocol via a complex cryptographic algorithm). Therefore, users have a high degree of control over and autonomy and trust of the data and its integrity. Blockchain allows for reaching a substantial level of historicity and inviolability of data for the whole document flow in a clinical trial. Hence, it ensures traceability, prevents a posteriori reconstruction and allows for securely automating the clinical trial through what are called Smart Contracts. At the same time, the technology ensures fine-grained control of the data, its security and its shareable parameters, for a single patient or group of patients or clinical trial stakeholders.In this commentary article, we explore the core functionalities of Blockchain applied to clinical trials and we illustrate concretely its general principle in the context of consent to a trial protocol. Trying to figure out the potential impact of Blockchain implementations in the setting of clinical trials will shed new light on how modern clinical trial methods could evolve and benefit from Blockchain technologies in order to tackle the aforementioned challenges.</td>

      <td>Blockchain – A Disruptive Technology</td>
      <td>Blockchain technology and distributed ledgers are attracting massive attention and trigger multiple projects in different industries. However, the financial industry is seen as a primary user of the blockchain concept. This is not only due to the fact that the most well-known application of this technology is the crypto-currency Bitcoin, but it is also driven by substantial process inefficiencies and a massive cost base issue specifically in this industry. On top of this, the financial crisis revealed that even in financial services it is not always possible to identify the correct present owner of an asset. It is even more of a problem to retrace ownership over a longer chain of changing buyers in global financial transaction services: when, e.g., the US investment bank Bear Stearns failed in 2008 and was completely acquired by JP Morgan Chase, the number of shares offered to the acquirer was larger than the shares outstanding in the books of Bear Stearns. It was not possible to clarify the accounting errors and JP Morgan Chase had to bear the damage from excess (digital) shares.\n\nWhile the problem of tracing back ownership in long transaction chains is already a critical aspect in financial markets, it is also important for physical goods, e.g., (blood) diamonds or broccoli. US retailer Wal-Mart with more than 260 million customers per week is in search for a technology that helps to identify precisely those batches of vegetables that in a given case, e.g., are infected by coliform bacteria.\n\nIntermediation is today’s dominating solution for verifying ownership of assets and transaction processing. Intermediaries perform the careful checking of each involved party along a chain of intermediaries. However, this is not only time consuming and costly but also bears a credit risk in case an intermediary fails. The blockchain technology promises to overcome these critical aspects, representing “a shift from trusting people to trusting math” (Antonopoulos 2014) since human interventions are no longer necessary.</td>

We begin our discussion with EOS, an Ethereum competitor built with an OS inspired architecture and platform-support design philosophy. It uses a new consensus mechanism called delegated proof-of-stake to enable rapid transaction verification and a continuous cycle of voting for delegates that support the network. The message passing protocols implemented in EOS are very advanced, allowing automated response handlers and action triggers on message delivery. They make up most of the smart contract system. There is also support for parallel lockless execution of smart contract instructions across the network, massively reducing latency in communication and state updates.</td>

      <td>Understanding the Blockchain Using Enterprise Ontology</td>
      <td>Blockchain technology is regarded as highly disruptive, but there is a lack of formalization and standardization of terminology. Not only because there are several (sometimes propriety) implementation platforms, but also because the academic literature so far is predominantly written from either a purely technical or an economic application perspective. The result of the confusion is an offspring of blockchain solutions, types, roadmaps and interpretations. For blockchain to be accepted as a technology standard in established industries, it is pivotal that ordinary internet users and business executives have a basic yet fundamental understanding of the workings and impact of blockchain. This conceptual paper provides a theoretical contribution and guidance on what blockchain actually is by taking an ontological approach. Enterprise Ontology is used to make a clear distinction between the datalogical, infological and essential level of blockchain transactions and smart contracts.</td>

      <td>This paper discusses the life cycle of decentralized smart contracts, i.e. digital and executable representations of rights and obligations in a multi-party environment. The life cycle relies on blockchain technology, i.e. a distributed digital ledger, to ensure proper implementation and integrity of the smart contracts. The life cycle consists of four subsequent phases: Creation, freezing, execution, and finalization. For each phase actors and technological services are identified and explained in detail. With the life cycle at hand, risks and limitations of smart contracts and the underlying blockchain technology are briefly discussed.</td>

      <td>Foundations of Blockchain</td>
      <td>The blockchain is a decentralized data structure with internal consistency maintained through consensus reached by all the users on the current state of the network. It’s an enabling technology that resolved the Byzantine generals’ problem (message communication between untrusted parties) and opened up a new horizon of possibilities for trustless transactions and exchange of information. If the Internet democratized the peer-to-peer exchange of information, then the blockchain has democratized the peer-to-peer exchange of value. We begin this chapter by exploring how transactions work between users on the Bitcoin network. This entails a technical discussion of structures of a block and a transaction. We then dive into the role of wallets and user addresses. After talking about wallets, we shift our focus to simple payment verification (SPV) implemented in the Bitcoin network. SPV allows us to understand why blocks have a peculiar structure and more important, how the Bitcoin network can retain efficiency despite the network scaling at a high rate. Finally, we conclude our discussion by talking about hard and soft forks in the blockchain. We present the implications of forks in the context of forward compatibility for merchants and users involved in running the Bitcoin-core code.</td>

      <td>Formal Modeling and Verification of Smart Contracts</td>
      <td>Smart contracts can automatically perform the contract terms according to the received information, and it is one of the most important research fields in digital society. The core of smart contracts is algorithm contract, that is, the parties reach an agreement on the contents of the contract and perform the contracts according to the behaviors written in certain computer algorithms. It not only needs to make sure about the correctness of smart contracts code, but also should provide a credible contract code execution environment. Blockchain provides a trusted execution and storage environment for smart contracts by the distributed secure storage, consistency verification and encryption technology. Current challenge is how to assure that smart contract can be executed as the parties' willingness. This paper introduces formal modeling and verification in formal methods to make smart contract model and verify the properties of smart contracts. Formal methods combined with smart contracts aim to reduce the potential errors and cost during contract development process. The description of a general and formal smart contract template is provided. The tool of model checking, SPIN, is used to verify the correctness and necessary properties for a smart contract template. The research shows model checking will be useful and necessary for smart contracts.</td>

Although the Github\ncurrently hosts more than six thousand active Blockchain software (BCS)\nprojects, few software engineering research has investigated these projects and\nits' contributors. Although the number of BCS projects is growing rapidly, the\nmotivations, challenges, and needs of BCS developers remain a puzzle.\nTherefore, the primary objective of this study is to understand the\nmotivations, challenges, and needs of BCS developers and analyze the\ndifferences between BCS and non-BCS development. On this goal, we sent an\nonline survey to 1,604 active BCS developers identified via mining the Github\nrepositories of 145 popular BCS projects. The survey received 156 responses\nthat met our criteria for analysis.\nThe results suggest that the majority of the BCS developers are experienced\nin non-BCS development and are primarily motivated by the ideology of creating\na decentralized financial system. Although most of the BCS projects are Open\nSource Software (OSS) projects by nature, more than 93% of our respondents\nfound BCS development somewhat different from a non-BCS development as BCS\nprojects have higher emphasis on security and reliability than most of the\nnon-BCS projects. Other differences include: higher costs of defects,\ndecentralized and hostile environment, technological complexity, and difficulty\nin upgrading the software after release. Software development tools that are\ntuned for non-BCS development are inadequate for BCS and the ecosystem needs an\narray of new or improved tools, such as: customized IDE for BCS development\ntasks, debuggers for smart-contracts, testing support, easily deployable\nsimulators, and BCS domain specific design notations.\n\n</td>

The blockchain network was originated from the Internet financial\nsector as a decentralized, immutable ledger system for transactional data\nordering. Nowadays, it is envisioned as a powerful backbone/framework for\ndecentralized data processing and data-driven self-organization in flat,\nopen-access networks. In particular, the plausible characteristics of\ndecentralization, immutability and self-organization are primarily owing to the\nunique decentralized consensus mechanisms introduced by blockchain networks.\nThis survey is motivated by the lack of a comprehensive literature review on\nthe development of decentralized consensus mechanisms in blockchain networks.\nIn this survey, we provide a systematic vision of the organization of\nblockchain networks. By emphasizing the unique characteristics of incentivized\nconsensus in blockchain networks, our in-depth review of the state-of-the-art\nconsensus protocols is focused on both the perspective of distributed consensus\nsystem design and the perspective of incentive mechanism design. From a\ngame-theoretic point of view, we also provide a thorough review on the strategy\nadoption for self-organization by the individual nodes in the blockchain\nbackbone networks. Consequently, we provide a comprehensive survey on the\nemerging applications of the blockchain networks in a wide range of areas.

      <td>Smart Contract Programming Languages on Blockchains: An Empirical Evaluation of Usability and Security</td>
      <td>\nBlockchain is a promising infrastructural technology that is finding its way into a growing number of domains like big data, finance, and medical. While blockchain has come to be thought of primarily as the foundation for Bitcoin, it has evolved far beyond underpinning the virtual currency. As it becomes progressively popular, the need for effective programming means would be more demanding. Blockchain programming as a core means provides accounts of the ‘code is law’ that specifies agreements between parties and allows its stakeholders to still trust the platform to execute the agreed-upon contract (known as smart contract) as expected. Although it seems straightforward in theory, it is hardly the case when it comes to real-life situations. There have been several instances that show smart contracts are riddled with issues and vulnerabilities in code, causing damages. What’s for sure is lacking is that the existing languages are not living up to the point to be able to unleash the full potential of the blockchain, as often have resulted in buggy code with a steep learning curve for developers. This denotes that the current research on contract development is not sufficient and is still in a stage of infancy. In order to advance the state of the research in this area, an evaluation of the current state-of-the-art practices in a thorough and experimental manner is required. Thus, the objective of this paper is to give a comprehensive analysis of such domain-specific programming practices from critical points of usability and security to provide a working guideline for newcomers and researchers.</td>

      <td>Ride-hailing service is gaining an increasing popularity due to its great advantages on fare estimation, automatic payments, and reputation ratings. However, how to build the trust between the driver and the passenger and achieve the secure billing still remains an open challenge. This paper proposes a novel secure billing protocol which removes the presence of the online third party by a smart contract on a publicly-verifiable two-party blockchain. In the proposed secure billing protocol, the driver and the passenger generate a blockchain which contains information about the ride. The driver and the passenger measure their own trajectories respectively in rounds. At the end of each round, they exchange their trajectories of the current round. If the difference of trajectories is within a threshold, they jointly compute the fare of current round. After completing the computation, the passenger pays the driver the fare of the current round via a micropayment channel. The driver and the passenger end each round by adding the information generated in this round into the blockchain. The blockchain can be considered as an evidence of the ride since it contains all the information of the ride. We evaluate the performance and the effectiveness of the proposed protocol via extensive experiments and detailed analysis.</td>

Method: We sent an online survey to 1,604 active BCS developers identified via mining the Github repositories of 145 popular BCS projects. The survey received 156 responses that met our criteria for analysis. Results: We found that code review and unit testing are the two most effective software development practices among BCS developers. The results suggest that the requirements of BCS projects are mostly identified and selected by community discussion and project owners which is different from requirement collection of general OSS projects. The results also reveal that the development tasks in BCS projects are primarily assigned on voluntary basis, which is the usual task assignment practice for OSS projects. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that standard software engineering methods including testing and security best practices need to be adapted with more seriousness to address unique characteristics of blockchain and mitigate potential threats.</td>

      <td>The ability of blockchain technology to record transactions on distributed ledgers offers new opportunities for governments to improve transparency, prevent fraud, and establish trust in the public sector. However, blockchain adoption and use in the context of e-Government is rather unexplored in academic literature. In this paper, we systematically review relevant research to understand the current research topics, challenges and future directions regarding blockchain adoption for e-Government. The results show that the adoption of blockchain-based applications in e-Government is still very limited and there is a lack of empirical evidence. The main challenges faced in blockchain adoption are predominantly presented as technological aspects such as security, scalability and flexibility. From an organizational point of view, the issues of acceptability and the need of new governance models are presented as the main barriers to adoption. Moreover, the lack of legal and regulatory support is identified as the main environmental barrier of adoption. Based on the challenges presented in the literature, we propose future research questions that need to be addressed to inform how the public sector should approach the blockchain technology adoption.</td>

This paper summarizes the conditions of blockchain research in terms of technology and its implementation. This paper was written using a systematic literature review (SLR) as one of the methodologies used to solve problems by tracing the results of previous studies. The problem that you want to study in SLR is usually referred to as a research question (RQ). The defined RQ is related to the topic and clarifies each question by tracing previous research papers indexed in reputable journal databases such as IEEE Xplore, Springerlink, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. After synthesizing 41 articles, the result is: blockchain can be used in many applications, some applications that adopt blockchain technology are banking applications, e-voting applications and digital forensic applications. Often, applications that use blockchain technology only focus on developing one of the blockchain technologies that suits their needs. Some developers maximize the components of the contract on the blockchain, some further develop the data structure of the blockchain itself. The use of blockchain technology is still wide open for the implementation of other information systems. The expected contribution of this paper is to provide a general overview for researchers who want to build applications that use blockchain as a basis for researching so they can conduct further studies to better understand whether the applications they will develop are suitable for using blockchain technology as a basis.</td>

However, it is one of the most transparent payment networks since all transactions are publicly announced. Blockchain, which is the public ledger of Bitcoin, includes all transactions to prevent double-spending and to provide integrity. By using data in the blockchain, flow of bitcoins between transactions can be observed and activities of the users can be traced. When the implications obtained from the blockchain are combined with external data, identity and profile of a user can be revealed. This possibility has undesirable effects such as spending history of a user becomes accessible to other people, or cash flow of a merchant becomes exposed to competitors. There are several proposals as extensions or alternatives to Bitcoin, which improve anonymity and privacy.

By means of a dual literature review we find that 1) the conceptualization of trust differs substantially between the contexts of blockchain and the sharing economy, 2) blockchain technology is to some degree suitable to replace trust in platform providers, and that 3) trust-free systems are hardly transferable to sharing economy interactions and will crucially depend on the development of trusted interfaces for blockchain-based sharing economy ecosystems.</td>

      <td>Interconnecting cyber-physical systems in networks leads to the creation of cyber-physical system-of-systems. In a cyber-physical system-of-systems (CPSoS), systems communicate by exchanging and sharing data and information, which this chapter also refers to as interoperability of information. To ensure reliable and secure interoperability of information between distributed cyber-physical systems, using blockchain technology or distributed ledging technology for distributed entities is an interesting option. Such a blockchain must, at a minimum, be fault tolerant and enable the entities involved to reach consensus on the information transactions that are to be performed. Once consensus about transactions between cyber-physicals is reached, it must be possible for these to record consistently the used data in a distributed ledger that provides a permanent shared overview of completed information transactions. The development of the new technology we call blockchain creates a new and as yet unfathomable reality of interconnected autonomous and self-organising cyber-physical systems that have the ability to make decisions about or for us as human beings.</td>

      <td>Blockchain is a disruptive technology with the potential to have a significant impact on business models and industries, similar to the adoption of Internet. Blockchain promotes distributed, open, inclusive, immutable, and secure architectural approaches, instead of centralized, hidden, exclusive, and alterable alternatives. The adoption of blockchain in the healthcare domain offers promising solutions for securing communications among stakeholders, efficient delivery of clinical reports, and integrating various kinds of private health records of individuals on a secure infrastructure. Accordingly, the main aim of this study is to propose a holistic blockchain structure covering all stakeholders in the healthcare domain and to analyse opportunities and challenges by presenting an integrated blockchain architecture. The comprehensive view of blockchain based healthcare system consists of services as follows: personal medical health record storage and access, personal genomic data storage and access, inventory tracking and buy-sell mechanism, health research commons, health document notary services, doctor services, digital health wallet, peer-to peer insurance. The opportunities of using blockchain in the healthcare domain are considered with respect to several viewpoints such as transparency, accountability, decentralization, record accuracy, secure transactions, interoperability, lower costs, collaboration, agility, individualized care with specialized treatment, improved diagnosis methods, risk of insurance contract, prevention of counterfeit drugs and improved quality of medical research. Challenges associated with the implementation of blockchain in the healthcare domain are also highlighted, such as governance, lack of legacy, privacy, sustainability, scalability, adoption of participation, and cost of operations.</td>

This technology is simplifying financial markets—many organizations are launching initial coin offerings to facilitate the financing of new business ventures; moreover, ‘securities’ that are issued in such a digital form can be bought and sold in the secondary market without the intervention of the traditional intermediaries. However, this use of blockchain could give rise to many problems which, in this article, will be analysed from the prospective of insolvency law. This paper will argue: first, that these problems originate from the fact that the issuance of blockchain securities is creating a divide between the world where securities are issued, offered and sold, and the world where law is enforceable; secondly, that these problems cannot be managed easily because of the lack of an apt point of attack, rather than because of the claim that the principle of technological neutrality should be observed; thirdly, that—under certain conditions—the sandbox approach that is being adopted by the UK financial conduct authority could contribute to directly shaping the platforms in pursuit of regulatory goals.</td>

Attribution, data, subject anonymity, data post processing (e.g., via smart contracts) and archiving, publication, research evaluation, incentivization, and research fund distribution would thereby become time-stamped, comprehensible, open (at will), and provable to the external world. Currently, scientists must be trusted to provide a true and useful representation of their research results in their final publication; blockchain would make much larger parts of the research cycle open to scientific self-correction. This bears the potential to be a new approach to the current reproducibility crisis in science, and could “reduce waste and make more research results true”. Beyond that, blockchain could be used to reduce overhead, and accelerate the scientific process and incentivize true innovation.</td>

Bitcoin peer-to-peer transactions are independent of the banking system, facilitating foreign exchanges with low transaction fees, such as remittances, and offering a high degree of anonymity. These opportunities together with other key factors led the Bitcoin to become extremely popular and caused its price to skyrocket during 2017 (Henry et al. in J Digit Bank 2(4):311–337, 2018).However, while the Bitcoin blockchain attracts a lot of attention, it remains difficult to investigate where this attention comes from, due to the pseudo-anonymity of the system, and consequently to appreciate its social impact. Here we make an attempt to characterize the adoption of the Bitcoin blockchain by country. In the first part of the work we show that information about the number of Bitcoin software client downloads, the IP addresses that act as relays for the transactions, and the Internet searches about Bitcoin provide together a coherent picture of the system evolution in different countries. Using these quantities as a proxy for user adoption, we identify several socio-economic indexes such as the GDP per capita, freedom of trade and the Internet penetration as key variables correlated with the degree of user adoption.In the second part of the work, we build a network of Bitcoin transactions between countries using the IP addresses of nodes relaying transactions and we develop an augmented version of the gravity model of trade in order to identify socio-economic factors linked to the flow of Bitcoin between countries. In a nutshell our study provides a new insight on Bitcoin adoption by country and on the potential socio-economic drivers of the international Bitcoin flow.</td>

Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the blockchain technology enables the decentralized consensus recording of success of debt repayment or debt default rendered by verifying and validating certain lending and borrowing activities in distributed ledgers. In the newly proposed blockchain embedded credit system, SMEs with low-risk and high-quality could display their credibility and risk class through information distribution. They are more likely to access bank loans even if they are not able to provide collateral. Results derived from the theoretical model present two main findings. First, the alleviation of information asymmetry and credit rationing problems can be achieved through decentralized consensus and information distribution among all participants. Second, the risk sharing mechanism involving government, banks and firms, will not only make the establishment of such an innovative system possible, but also create risk pool for the blockchain based lending and borrowing.</td>

In this paper, we conduct a systematic survey with the aim of pointing out the areas in which blockchain technology applications and services are being developed both in the public and private sector. In the results, we discuss the disruptive effect that this technology could bring to various business sectors as well as the concerns regarding the development of the blockchain technology.\n</td>

      <td>Review on Blockchain Application for Internet of Things</td>
      <td>\nInternet of Things (IoT) is a network that connects lots of smart devices around the world. As a revolutionary technology, it has been developing rapidly in recent years. This paper summarizes the obstacles of IoT in terms of security and efficient operation network and introduces the Blockchain to solve these problems. Nowadays, many IoT application use the traditional central structure and collect all data in one center node. However, with connected devices on the rise, it is required that the center node should have a huge computing power, storage space and bandwidth, thus making the operation cost become higher. For IoT, another focus is all about private and security. All transaction data are stored in the third party, which means hackers can break security barriers and steal user information easily. Moreover, some businessmen will sell user information to other parties without owner’s authorization. Through this paper we find that Blockchain can provide a distributed, transparent platform with trustless mechanism and collective maintenance of security for the IoT. But, applying Blockchain directly to IoT may result in many problems, such as limited resource, longer delays, poor scalability. At present, there is not a Blockchain model which can be applied in large scale IoT networks. The future study can be followed along this line.</td>

      <td>This chapter discusses how the widespread adoption of blockchain technology (distributed ledgers) might contribute to solving a larger class of economic problems related to systemic risk, specifically the degree of systemic risk in financial networks (ongoing credit relationships between parties). The chapter introduces economic network theory, drawing from König and Battiston (2009). Then, Part I develops payment network analysis (analyzing immediate cash transfers) in the classical payment network setting (Fedwire (Soramäki 2007)) synthesized with the cryptocurrency environment (Bitcoin (Maesa 2017), Monero (Miller 2017), and Ripple (Moreno-Sanchez et al. 2018)). The key finding is that the replication of network statistical behavior in cryptographic networks indicates the robust (not merely anecdotal) adoption of blockchain systems. Part II addresses balance sheet network analysis (ongoing obligations over time), first from the classical sense of central bank balance sheet network analysis developed by Castrén (2009, 2013), Gai and Kapadia (2010), and Chan-Lau (2010), and then proposes how blockchain economic networks might help solve systemic risk problems. The chapter concludes with the potential economic and social benefits of blockchain economic networks, particularly as a new technological affordance is created, algorithmic trust, to support financial systems.</td>

Blockchain’s foundations of decentralisation, cryptographic security and immutability make it a strong contender in reshaping the healthcare landscape worldwide. Blockchain solutions are currently being explored for: (1) securing patient and provider identities; (2) managing pharmaceutical and medical device supply chains; (3) clinical research and data monetisation; (4) medical fraud detection; (5) public health surveillance; (6) enabling truly public and open geo-tagged data; (7) powering many Internet of Things-connected autonomous devices, wearables, drones and vehicles, via the distributed peer-to-peer apps they run, to deliver the full vision of smart healthy cities and regions; and (8) blockchain-enabled augmented reality in crisis mapping and recovery scenarios, including mechanisms for validating, crediting and rewarding crowdsourced geo-tagged data, among other emerging use cases. Geospatially-enabled blockchain solutions exist today that use a crypto-spatial coordinate system to add an immutable spatial context that regular blockchains lack. These geospatial blockchains do not just record an entry’s specific time, but also require and validate its associated proof of location, allowing accurate spatiotemporal mapping of physical world events. Blockchain and distributed ledger technology face similar challenges as any other technology threatening to disintermediate legacy processes and commercial interests, namely the challenges of blockchain interoperability, security and privacy, as well as the need to find suitable and sustainable business models of implementation. Nevertheless, we expect blockchain technologies to get increasingly powerful and robust, as they become coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) in various real-word healthcare solutions involving AI-mediated data exchange on blockchains.</td>

So far, there have been use cases of this technology for cryptocurrencies, digital contracts, financial and public records, and property ownership. It is expected that future uses will expand into medicine, science, education, intellectual property, and supply chain management. Likely applications in the field of medicine could include electronic health records, health insurance, biomedical research, drug supply and procurement processes, and medical education. Utilization of blockchain is not without its weaknesses and currently, this technology is extremely immature and lacks public or even expert knowledge, making it hard to have a clear strategic vision of its true future potential. Presently, there are issues with scalability, security of smart contracts, and user adoption. Nevertheless, with capital investments into blockchain technology projected to reach US$400 million in 2019, health professionals and decision makers should be aware of the transformative potential that blockchain technology offers for healthcare organizations and medical practice.</td>

Not only may blockchain be regarded as a by-product of Bitcoin cryptocurrency systems, but also it is a type of distributed ledger technologies through using a trustworthy, decentralized log of totally ordered transactions. By summarizing the literature of blockchain, it is found that more and more important research is to develop basic theory, for example, mathematical models (Markov processes, queueing theory and game models) for mining management and consensus mechanism, performance analysis and optimization of blockchain systems. In this paper, we develop queueing theory of blockchain systems and provide system performance evaluation. To do this, we design a Markovian batch-service queueing system with two different service stages, which are suitable to well express the mining process in the miners pool and the building of a new blockchain. By using the matrix-geometric solution, we obtain a system stable condition and express three key performance measures: (a) The average number of transactions in the queue, (b) the average number of transactions in a block, and (c) the average transaction-confirmation time. Finally, we use numerical examples to verify computability of our theoretical results. Although our queueing model here is simple only under exponential or Poisson assumptions, our analytic method will open a series of potentially promising research in queueing theory of blockchain systems.</td>

      <td>Integrating Digital Identity and Blockchain</td>
      <td>Blockchain is a recent technology whose importance is rapidly growing. One of its native features is pseudo-anonymity, since users are referred by (blockchain) addresses, which are hashed public keys with no link to real identities. However, when moving from the use of blockchain as simple platform for cryptocurrencies to applications in which we want to automatize trust and transparency, in general, there is not the need of anonymity. Indeed, there are situations in which secure accountability, trust and transparency should coexist (e.g., in supply-chain management) to accomplish the goal of the application to design. Blockchain may appear little suitable for these cases, due to its pseudo-anonymity feature, so that an important research problem is to understand how to overcome this drawback. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a solution that mixes the mechanism of public digital identity with blockchain via Identity-Based-Encryption. We define the solution and show its application to a real-life case study.</td>

To address this gap, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional emergent framework for DLT adoption within the construction sector. The framework was developed following a focus group discussion and took a socio-technical systems approach that encompasses three dimensions: political, social and technical. The framework was overlaid with an extensive set of construction-related challenges and opportunities and identified a number of associated agents across the dimensions. The structured and inter-connected dimensions provided by the framework can be used by field researchers as a point of departure to investigate a range of research questions from political, social or technical perspectives.</td>

In developing countries, which are seen as a fertile ground for field testing disruptive technologies, blockchain is viewed as the “trust machine” that is necessary for accelerating development. Unfortunately, the internal working of blockchain as well as its constraints are often overlooked in the design of services. This, in conjunction with a poor regulatory framework, slows down any concrete attempt to build upon the technology. In this paper, we contribute towards accelerating the concrete adoption of blockchain by making explicit the constraints that affect their practical use in the context of developing countries such as African sub-saharan countries. Overall we recommend that the technology should be adjusted to the real-world constraints, in particular those that we currently witness on network latency, computation power as well as cultural gaps.</td>

The security of Bitcoin heavily relies on the incentive-compatible proof-of-work (PoW) based distributed consensus protocol, which is run by the network nodes called miners. In exchange for the incentive, the miners are expected to maintain the blockchain honestly. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin economy has grown at an enormous rate, and it is now worth about 150 billions of dollars. This exponential growth in the market value of bitcoins motivate adversaries to exploit weaknesses for profit, and researchers to discover new vulnerabilities in the system, propose countermeasures, and predict upcoming trends. In this paper, we present a systematic survey that covers the security and privacy aspects of Bitcoin. We start by giving an overview of the Bitcoin system and its major components along with their functionality and interactions within the system. We review the existing vulnerabilities in Bitcoin and its major underlying technologies such as blockchain and PoW-based consensus protocol. These vulnerabilities lead to the execution of various security threats to the standard functionality of Bitcoin. We then investigate the feasibility and robustness of the state-of-the-art security solutions. Additionally, we discuss the current anonymity considerations in Bitcoin and the privacy-related threats to Bitcoin users along with the analysis of the existing privacy-preserving solutions. Finally, we summarize the critical open challenges, and we suggest directions for future research towards provisioning stringent security and privacy solutions for Bitcoin.</td>

This added considerable complexity to the current blockchain\necosystems, amplified by the absence of detail in many accompanying blockchain\nwhitepapers.\nThrough this paper, we set out to explain blockchains in a simple way, taming\nthat complexity through the deconstruction of the blockchain into three simple,\ncritical components common to all known systems: membership selection,\nconsensus mechanism and structure. We propose an evaluation framework with\ninsight into system models, desired properties and analysis criteria, using the\ndecoupled components as criteria. We use this framework to provide clear and\nintuitive overviews of the design principles behind the analyzed systems and\nthe properties achieved. We hope our effort will help clarifying the current\nstate of blockchain proposals and provide directions to the analysis of future\nproposals.\n\n</td>

      <td>\nAbstract:  The blockchain technology is taking the world by storm. Blockchain with its\ndecentralized, transparent and secure nature has emerged as a disruptive\ntechnology for the next generation of numerous industrial applications. One of\nthem is Cloud of Things enabled by the corporation of Cloud computing and\nInternet of Things (IoT). In this context, blockchain provides innovative\nsolutions to address challenges in Cloud of Things in terms of\ndecentralization, data privacy and network security, while Cloud of Things\noffer elasticity and scalability functionalities to improve efficiency of\nblockchain operations. Therefore, a novel paradigm of blockchain and Cloud of\nThings combination, called as the BCoT model, is regarded as a promising\nenabler for a wide range of applied scenarios. In this paper, we present a\nstate-of-the-art review on the BCoT integration to provide general readers with\nthe overview of the BCoT in various aspects, including background knowledge,\nmotivation, and integrated architecture. Particularly, we also provide an\nin-depth survey of BCoT applications with extensive discussion on use-case\ndomains as well as their opportunities in 5G networks and beyond. Compared to\nother relevant survey papers, we present a thorough review on the emerging BCoT\nplatforms and services which are useful to researchers and application\ndevelopers in identifying and catching up with the latest technologies in this\nfast-growing field.

While the first\ngeneration of blockchain technology (i.e., Blockchain 1.0) is almost\nexclusively used for cryptocurrency purposes, the second generation (i.e.,\nBlockchain 2.0), as represented by Ethereum, is an open and decentralized\nplatform enabling a new paradigm of computing --- Decentralized Applications\n(DApps) running on top of blockchains. The rich applications and semantics of\nDApps inevitably introduce many security vulnerabilities, which have no\ncounterparts in pure cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin. Since Ethereum is a\nnew, yet complex, system, it is imperative to have a systematic and\ncomprehensive understanding on its security from a holistic perspective, which\nis unavailable. To the best of our knowledge, the present survey, which can\nalso be used as a tutorial, fills this void. In particular, we systematize\nthree aspects of Ethereum systems security: vulnerabilities, attacks, and\ndefenses. We draw insights into, among other things, vulnerability root causes,\nattack consequences, and defense capabilities, which shed light on future\nresearch directions.\n\n</td>

      <td>An Empirical Study into the Success of Listed Smart Contracts in Ethereum</td>

In general this is not\npossible, but it is possible to follow best practices in order to maximise the\nchance of success. A smart contract is intended to encode business logic and is\ntherefore at the heart of every new business on the Ethereum blockchain. We\nhave investigated how to measure the success of smart contracts, and whether\nsuccessful smart contracts have characteristics that less successful smart\ncontracts lack. The appearance of a smart contract on a listing website such as\nEtherscan or StateoftheDapps is such a characteristic. In this paper, we\npresent a three-pronged analysis of the relative success of listed smart\ncontracts. First, we have used statistical analysis on the publicly visible\ntransaction history of the Ethereum blockchain to determine that listed\ncontracts are significantly more successful than their unlisted counterparts.\nNext, we have conducted a survey among more than 200 developers via an\nanonymous online survey about their experience with the listing process. A\nsignificant majority of respondents do not believe that listing a contract\nitself contributes to its success, but they believe that the extra attention\nthat is typically paid in tandem with the listing process does contribute.\nFinally, based on the respondents' answers, we have drafted 10 recommendations\nfor developers and validated them by submitting them to an international panel\nof experts.\n\n</td>

      <td>\nAbstract:  Smart contracts are software programs featuring both traditional applications\nand distributed data storage on blockchains. Ethereum is a prominent blockchain\nplatform with the support of smart contracts. The smart contracts act as\nautonomous agents in critical decentralized applications and hold a significant\namount of cryptocurrency to perform trusted transactions and agreements.\nMillions of dollars as part of the assets held by the smart contracts were\nstolen or frozen through the notorious attacks just between 2016 and 2018, such\nas the DAO attack, Parity Multi-Sig Wallet attack, and the integer\nunderflow/overflow attacks. These attacks were caused by a combination of\ntechnical flaws in designing and implementing software codes. However, many\nmore vulnerabilities of less severity are to be discovered because of the\nscripting natures of the Solidity language and the non-updateable feature of\nblockchains. Hence, we surveyed 16 security vulnerabilities in smart contract\nprograms, and some vulnerabilities do not have a proper solution. This survey\naims to identify the key vulnerabilities in smart contracts on Ethereum in the\nperspectives of their internal mechanisms and software security\nvulnerabilities. By correlating 16 Ethereum vulnerabilities and 19 software\nsecurity issues, we predict that many attacks are yet to be exploited. And we\nhave explored many software tools to detect the security vulnerabilities of\nsmart contracts in terms of static analysis, dynamic analysis, and formal\nverification. This survey presents the security problems in smart contracts\ntogether with the available analysis tools and the detection methods. We also\ninvestigated the limitations of the tools or analysis methods with respect to\nthe identified security vulnerabilities of the smart contracts.\n\n</td>

One of the main topics of\ninterest, given its importance, is the research and development of privacy\nmechanisms, as for example is the case of Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). ZKP is a\ncryptographic technique that can be used to hide information that is put into\nthe ledger, while still allowing to perform validation of this data. In this\nwork we describe different strategies to construct Zero Knowledge Range Proofs\n(ZKRP), as for example the scheme proposed by Boudot in 2001; the one proposed\nin 2008 by Camenisch et al, and Bulletproofs, proposed in 2017. We also compare\nthese strategies and discuss possible use cases. Since Bulletproofs is the most\nefficient construction, we will give a detailed description of its algorithms\nand optimizations. Bulletproofs is not only more efficient than previous\nschemes, but also avoids the trusted setup, which is a requirement that is not\ndesirable in the context of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and blockchain.\nIn case of cryptocurrencies, if the setup phase is compromised, it would be\npossible to generate money out of thin air. Interestingly, Bulletproofs can\nalso be used to construct generic Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), in the sense\nthat it can be used to prove generic statements, and thus it is not only\nrestricted to ZKRP, but it can be used for any kind of Proof of Knowledge\n(PoK). Hence Bulletproofs leads to a more powerful tool to provide privacy for\nDLT. Here we describe in detail the algorithms involved in Bulletproofs\nprotocol for ZKRP. Also, we present our implementation, which was open sourced.\n\n</td>

      <td>\nAbstract:  Smart contracts are programs running on a blockchain. They are immutable to\nchange, and hence can not be patched for bugs once deployed. Thus it is\ncritical to ensure they are bug-free and well-designed before deployment. A\nContract defect is an error, flaw or fault in a smart contract that causes it\nto produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways.\nThe detection of contract defects is a method to avoid potential bugs and\nimprove the design of existing code. Since smart contracts contain numerous\ndistinctive features, such as the gas system. decentralized, it is important to\nfind smart contract specified defects. To fill this gap, we collected\nsmart-contract-related posts from Ethereum StackExchange, as well as real-world\nsmart contracts. We manually analyzed these posts and contracts; using them to\ndefine 20 kinds of contract defects. We categorized them into indicating\npotential security, availability, performance, maintainability and reusability\nproblems. To validate if practitioners consider these contract as harmful, we\ncreated an online survey and received 138 responses from 32 different\ncountries. Feedback showed these contract defects are harmful and removing them\nwould improve the quality and robustness of smart contracts. We manually\nidentified our defined contract defects in 587 real world smart contract and\npublicly released our dataset. Finally, we summarized 5 impacts caused by\ncontract defects. These help developers better understand the symptoms of the\ndefects and removal priority.\n\n</td>

      <td>Blockchain Mutability: Challenges and Proposed Solutions</td>
      <td>\nAbstract:  Blockchain's evolution during the past decade is astonishing: from bitcoin to\nover 2.000 altcoins, and from decentralised electronic payments to transactions\nprogrammable by smart contracts and complex tokens governed by decentralised\norganisations. While the new generation of blockchain applications is still\nevolving, blockchain's technical characteristics are also advancing. Yet,\nimmutability, a hitherto indisputable property according to which blockchain\ndata cannot be edited nor deleted, remains the cornerstone of blockchain's\nsecurity. Nevertheless, blockchain's immutability is being called into question\nlately in the light of the new erasing requirements imposed by the GDPR's\n``\textit{Right to be Forgotten (RtbF)}'' provision. As the RtbF obliges\nblockchain data to be editable in order restricted content redactions,\nmodifications or deletions to be applied when requested, blockchains compliance\nwith the regulation is indeed challenging, if not impracticable. Towards\nresolving this contradiction, various methods and techniques for mutable\nblockchains have been proposed in an effort to satisfy regulatory erasing\nrequirements while preserving blockchains' security. To this end, this work\naims to provide a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art research\napproaches, technical workarounds and advanced cryptographic techniques that\nhave been put forward to resolve this conflict and to discuss their potentials,\nconstraints and limitations when applied in the wild to either permissioned or\npermissionless blockchains.\n\n</td>

It is believed that blockchain can be utilized in diverse Internet interactive systems (e.g., Internet of Things, supply chain systems, identity management, and so on). However, there are some privacy challenges that may hinder the applications of blockchain. The goal of this survey is to provide some insights into the privacy issues associated with blockchain. We analyze the privacy threats in blockchain and discuss existing cryptographic defense mechanisms, i.e., anonymity and transaction privacy preservation. Furthermore, we summarize some typical implementations of privacy preservation mechanisms in blockchain and explore future research challenges that still need to be addressed in order to preserve privacy when blockchain is used.</td>

Being the most expensive and the most popular cryptocurrency, both the business world and the research community have started to question the energy intensity of Bitcoin mining. This paper only focuses on computational power demand during the proof-of-work process rather than estimating the whole energy intensity of mining. We make use of 160GB of Bitcoin blockchain data to estimate the energy consumption and power demand of Bitcoin mining. We considered the performance of 269 different hardware models (CPU, GPU, FPGA, and ASIC). For estimations, we defined two metrics, namely; minimum consumption and maximum consumption. The targeted time span for the analysis was from 3 January 2009 to 5 June 2018. We show that the historical peak of power consumption of Bitcoin mining took place during the bi-weekly period commencing on 18 December 2017 with a demand of between 1.3 and 14.8 GW. This maximum demand figure was between the installed capacities of Finland (∼16 GW) and Denmark (∼14 GW). We also show that, during June 2018, energy consumption of Bitcoin mining from difficulty recalculation was between 15.47 and 50.24 TWh per year.</td>

A smart contract is a mechanism involving digital assets and some parties, where the parties deposit assets into the contract and the contract redistributes the assets among the parties based on provisions of the smart contract and inputs of the parties. Recently, several smart contract systems are constructed that use zk-SNARKs to provide privacy-preserving payments and interconnections in the contracts (e.g. Hawk [KMS+16] and Gyges [JKS16]). Efficiency of such systems severely are dominated by efficiency of the underlying UC-secure zk-SNARK that is achieved using C\(\emptyset \)C\(\emptyset \) framework [KZM+15] applied on a non-UC-secure zk-SNARK. In this paper, we show that recent progresses on zk-SNARKs, allow one to simplify the structure and also improve the efficiency of both systems with a UC-secure zk-SNARK that has simpler construction and better efficiency in comparison with the currently used ones. More precisely, with minimal changes, we present a variation of Groth and Maller’s zk-SNARK from Crypto 2017, and show that it achieves UC-security and has better efficiency than the ones that currently are used in Hawk and Gyges. We believe, new variation can be of independent interest.\n\n</td>

      <td>Verification of Smart Contract Business Logic</td>
      <td>\nSmart contracts have been argued to be a means of building trust between parties by providing a self-executing equivalent of legal contracts. And yet, code does not always perform what it was originally intended to do, which resulted in losses of millions of dollars. Static verification of smart contracts is thus a pressing need. This paper presents an approach to verifying smart contracts written in Solidity by automatically translating Solidity into Java and using KeY, a deductive Java verification tool. In particular, we solve the problem of rolling back the effects of aborted transactions by exploiting KeY’s native support of JavaCard transactions. We apply our approach to a smart contract which automates a casino system, and discuss how the approach addresses a number of known shortcomings of smart contract development in Solidity.</td>

There have not been enough literature investigating the adoption and acceptance of the cryptocurrency by users. The aim of this paper is to fill the gap in the current literature by investigating the current cryptocurrency adoption level, adoption-influencing factors, providing an in-depth analysis of these factors and discussing some pitfalls surrounding the cryptocurrency adoption. We believe that despite the difficulty to find out an accurate number of cryptocurrency users, a good estimate can be made by studying the number of cryptocurrency exchange sites' users. In addition, the paper suggests that the main factors driving the adoption decision revealed from the literature review are the investment opportunity cryptocurrency forms, the anonymity of the transactions and privacy, the acceptance by businesses as a payment method, the fast transfer of funds, the low cost of transactions, and technological curiosity. The research findings help researchers, regulators, and cryptocurrency developers to better understand their consumer's intention toward cryptocurrency adoption.</td>

      <td>A survey on blockchain cybersecurity vulnerabilities and possible countermeasures</td>
      <td>SummaryBlockchain technology has attracted considerable attention owing to its wide range of potential applications. It first appeared as a cryptocurrency, called Bitcoin, but has since been used in many other business and nonbusiness applications. Unlike most existing systems that are based on centralized frameworks, this new technology utilizes peer‐to‐peer networks and distributed systems which includes blockchain registers to store transactions. Its structure is designed as a digital log file and stored as a series of linked groups, called blocks. Each individual block is locked cryptographically with the previous block. Once a block has been added, it cannot be altered. Many security experts speculate that the inherent cryptographic nature of the blockchain system is sufficient to withstand constant hacking and security threats. However, previous studies on the security and privacy of blockchain technology have shown that many applications have fallen victim to successful cyberattacks. Owing to the increasing demand for cryptocurrency and its current security challenges, previous studies have not focused on blockchain technology cybersecurity vulnerabilities extensively. Here, our study extends upon the previous studies on vulnerabilities and investigates the types of potential attacks. Our study then provides further direction to highlight possible countermeasures against blockchain technology vulnerability to cybersecurity.Study presents a review on security threats and vulnerabilities in existing cryptocurrency systems that include the possibility of attacks with a focus on issues related to user privacy and transaction anonymity. The real attacks on blockchain systems are investigated, and current possible countermeasure methods by attack types are discussed. Furthermore, practical and academic merits to enhance the security of blockchain and limitations of state‐of‐the‐art security solutions are summarized and discussed, and future directions in area of blockchain security are suggested.\n\n                        View Figure\n</td>

In this work, we focus on the technological aspect only, highlighting the unprecedented complexity of I4.0 emerging from the scientific literature. While previous works have focused on one or up to four related enablers, we consider ten technological enablers, including besides the most cited Big Data, Internet of Things, and Cloud Computing, also others more rarely considered as Fog and Mobile Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Human-Computer Interaction, Robotics, down to the often overlooked, very recent, or taken for granted Open-Source Software, Blockchain, and the Internet.

Finally we provide a detailed analysis of challenges in leveraging each of the enablers in I4.0, evidencing possible roadblocks to be overcome and pointing at possible future directions of research. Our goal is to provide a reference for the experts in some of the technological fields involved, for a reconnaissance of integration and hybridization possibilities with other fields in the endeavor of I4.0, as well as for the laymen, for a high-level grasp of the variety (and often deep history) of the scientific research backing I4.0.</td>

      <td>Blockchain technology is growing massively where the number of blockchain platforms and decentralized applications are increasing rapidly in the last years. However, most of the existing blockchain networks are operating in a standalone environment isolated from each other, which increases scalability and connectivity issues in the current blockchain platforms as well as limiting the blockchain adoption in industry ecosystems. In the current phase, different blockchain networks don't have mutual trust where they cannot interact with each other and their capacity level has only reached a level similar to LAN. Due to the high barriers between the independent isolated blockchain platforms, researchers have started to focus on the concept of Blockchain interoperability. Blockchain interoperability is the ability of connecting multiple blockchain networks together, which significantly increases and solves scalability and connectivity issues in the blockchain platforms. Given the potential of blockchain interoperability and cross blockchain communication, many researchers are working on finding the optimal cross blockchain communication solution. As blockchain interoperability is emerging as an essential blockchain feature, the number of proposed blockchain interoperability solutions have been increasing within the last few years. In this paper, a survey of all the available cross blockchain communication solutions are discussed with a comparison of the proposed architectures.</td>

At the core of this interest are the ways in which blockchains can be used to improve data management, e.g., by enabling federated data management via decentralization, resilience against failure and malicious actors via replication and consensus, and strong data provenance via a secured immutable ledger.In practice, high-performance blockchains for data management are usually built in permissioned environments in which the participants are vetted and can be identified. In this setting, blockchains are typically powered by Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocols. These consensus protocols are used to provide full replication among all honest blockchain participants by enforcing an unique order of processing incoming requests among the participants.In this tutorial, we take an in-depth look at Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus. First, we take a look at the theory behind replicated computing and consensus. Then, we delve into how common consensus protocols operate.

As the oil and gas industry is gradually shifting toward intelligence and digitalization, many large oil and gas companies were working on blockchain technology in the past two years because of it can significantly improve the management level, efficiency, and data security of the oil and gas industry. This paper aims to let more people in the oil and gas industry understand the blockchain and lead more thinking about how to apply the blockchain technology. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the earliest papers on the review of the blockchain system in the oil and gas industry. This paper first presents the relevant theories and core technologies of the blockchain, and then describes how the blockchain is applied to the oil and gas industry from four aspects: trading, management and decision making, supervision, and cyber security. Finally, the application status, the understanding level of the blockchain in the oil and gas industry, opportunities, challenges, and risks and development trends are analyzed. The main conclusions are as follows: 1) at present, Europe and Asia have the fastest pace of developing the application of blockchain in the oil and gas industry, but there are still few oil and gas blockchain projects in operation or testing worldwide; 2) nowadays, the understanding of blockchain in the oil and gas industry is not sufficiently enough, the application is still in the experimental stage, and the investment is not enough; and (3) blockchain can bring many opportunities to the oil and gas industry, such as reducing transaction costs and improving transparency and efficiency. However, since it is still in the early stage of the application, there are still many challenges, primarily technological, and regulatory and system transformation. The development of blockchains in the oil and gas industry will move toward hybrid blockchain architecture, multi-technology combination, cross-chain, hybrid consensus mechanisms, and more interdisciplinary professionals.</td>

Data security assures that shared data is kept secure. In the network, data security is crucial against attackers and hackers. The data security is all about first to secure the information from pirated access and the second one is to protect from thwart hackers. The objective of network security is to keep the network running and safe for all legitimate users. The target of this paper is to present the merits and demerits of blockchain over data security in different sectors. The blockchain technology is used in various applications to store exchanges of values via transactions. All transactions made by nodes are signed digitally with the preceding transaction hash and the public key of the destination node; this scheme guarantees that transactions are tamper-proof. A block containing transactions will be approved by specific blockchain nodes. In block-chain technology, each page in a ledger of transactions forms a block. That block affects the next block or page through cryptographic hashing. In other words, when a block is finally completed, it creates a special secure code, that links to the next page or block, creating a chain of blocks, or block-chain. Data security can be accomplished using the block-chain concept. The hash tables of raw data files are stored on the blockchain, and other copies are validated by a hashing technique. Thus any interference with the data will be instantly found because the initial hash tables are stored on thousands of nodes.</td>

      <td>Privacy-Preserving Solutions for Blockchain: Review and Challenges</td>
      <td>Blockchains offer a decentralized, immutable and verifiable ledger that can record transactions of digital assets, provoking a radical change in several innovative scenarios, such as smart cities, eHealth or eGovernment. However, blockchains are subject to different scalability, security and potential privacy issues, such as transaction linkability, crypto-keys management (e.g. recovery), on-chain data privacy, or compliance with privacy regulations (e.g. GDPR). To deal with these challenges, novel privacy-preserving solutions for blockchain based on crypto-privacy techniques are emerging to empower users with mechanisms to become anonymous and take control of their personal data during their digital transactions of any kind in the ledger, following a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) model. In this sense, this paper performs a systematic review of the current state of the art on privacy-preserving research solutions and mechanisms in blockchain, as well as the main associated privacy challenges in this promising and disrupting technology. The survey covers privacy techniques in public and permissionless blockchains, e.g. Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as privacy-preserving research proposals and solutions in permissioned and private blockchains. Diverse blockchain scenarios are analyzed, encompassing, eGovernment, eHealth, cryptocurrencies, Smart cities, and Cooperative ITS.</td>

      <td>Blockchain innovations are having a profound effect on the global financial industry, yet little is known about how the emerging technology can potentially disrupt other industries. The supply chain industry represents a prominent and very promising application scenario for blockchain to enable transparency among untrusted stakeholders as well as increased efficiency and traceability throughout production and distribution processes, however there is a lack of empirical research available in that field. The primary purpose of this research is to address that research gap by exploring the application of blockchain technologies in supply chains. First, this research examines recent literature to identify current inefficiencies in existing supply chain information technologies. Secondly, key features of blockchain are identified to provide a clear understanding of the technology. Thirdly, current applications are documented and categorized to identify where blockchain applications can have the most impact on the three flows of the supply chain. The analysis shows most of the process areas in supply chain that blockchain is expected to improve are informational, which given the large amount of interdependencies between flows, has a positive impact on the subsequent financial and material flows. Finally, recommendations for future research are given to address further research questions.</td>

Consensus algorithm solves the problem of trust in blockchain. Consensus algorithms can be classified into two classes. The first class is voting-based consensus, which requires nodes in the blockchain network to broadcast their results of mining a new block or transaction, before appending the block to blockchain. The second class is proof-based consensus, which requires the nodes joining the blockchain network to solve and mathematical puzzle to show that they are more eligible than the others to do the appending or mining work. Performance of blockchain can be increased with the use of suitable consensus algorithm. However, theory and data support for the selecting suitable consensus in private blockchain is very limited.

In April 2018, the UAE government launched a Blockchain Strategy of 2021. Under this initiative, 50 percent of government transactions will be processed over a BC platform. Eleven billion dirhams are expected to be saved in transactions and documents prepared in the government sector. The UAE 2021 strategy includes four pillars, focusing on residence happiness, government efficiency, advanced legislation, and global entrepreneurship. In October 2016, the emirate of Dubai, launched a local BC strategy to become the first energy-powered city that leads the future economy by 2020. This motivation placed the Government of UAE as a unique and pioneered country in innovation and enabling the ecosystem to be addressed in both the public and private sectors. This strategy is based on three domains: government effectiveness, industry innovation, and international, domestic leadership. BC projects will be experimenting throughout the country in many sectors such as energy, transportation, logistics, tourism, health, education and employment, economic development, safety and justice, social services, municipal and land works. This paper study the state of art of the UAE strategy towards adopting BC technology among all its entities. A survey has been conducted to evaluate the strategic effectiveness of this new technology. The study involves a combination of 71 public and private companies that operate in the UAE. The outcome shows that there is a need to integrate this technology. At the same time, the survey concluded that 92.0% of the companies are aware of the technology.

However, with the rapid development, blockchain smart contracts have also exposed many security problems, and some attacks caused by contract vulnerabilities have led to terrible losses. In order to better deal with such dilemma, making a comprehensive survey about the security verification of blockchain smart contracts from major scientific databases is quite indispensable. Even though the significance of studying security verification of blockchain smart contracts is evident, it is really fresh yet. The major contributions of our survey work come from three aspects. First, after retrieving all-sided research studies, we select 53 most related papers to show the state-of-the art of this topic, where 20 papers focus on dealing with security assurance of blockchain smart contracts, and 33 papers focus on the correctness verification of blockchain smart contracts. Second, we propose a taxonomy toward the topic of security verification of blockchain smart contracts and discuss the pros and cons of each category of related studies. Third, through in-depth analysis of these studies, we come to know that the correctness verification of smart contracts based on the formal method has already become the more significant and more effective method to validate whether a smart contract is credible and accurate. So, we further present representative studies of formal verification of smart contracts in detail to demonstrate that using a formal method to validate blockchain smart contracts must have a promising and meritorious future.</td>

However, after doing research about this cyber-attack, we know that the hacker did not break the blockchain it-self, the hackers only cracked the exchange center instead. We then use blockchain to compare the security with other online-payment such as PayPal. After analyzing their behavior under the injection attack and a DDoS attack, we get a conclusion that blockchain can effectively defend those two attacks because of its immutable and distributed characteristic. However, even if blockchain is safe currently, there is a risk in the future from quantum computing. According to Divesh Aggarwal, the computing speed will significantly rise within 10 years, this means blockchain's encrypted signature might not be safe.

This is since any bugs or errors will become permanent once published to the live network, and could lead to substantial economic losses; as manifested in the infamous DAO smart contract exploit hack in 2016. In order to avoid this, formal verification methods can be used to ensure that the contract behaves according to given specifications. This paper presents a survey of the state of the art of formal verification of smart contracts. Being a relatively new research area, a standard or best practice for formal verification of smart contracts has not yet been established. Thus, several different methods and approaches have been used to perform the formal verification. The survey presented in this paper shows that some variant of model checking or theorem proving methodology seems to be most successful. However, as of today, formal verification is only successful on simple contracts, and does not support more advanced smart contract syntax.</td>

Thus, trust is effectively established in a literally trustless environment with purely computational means. This is especially critical in the digital formulation of smart contracts where clauses are to be strictly upheld by intelligent agents. The most prominent proof systems recently proposed in the scientific literature are reviewed. Additionally, the applications of blockchain technology to smart contracts is discussed.

In the last two decades, numerous IoT solutions have been developed by small, medium-sized, and large enterprises to make our lives easier. Furthermore, private and academic researchers have extensively investigated some practical IoT solutions. The rapid expansion of IoT solutions accompanies numerous security concerns because the underlying IoT protocols and communication technologies have not considered security. Recently, blockchain has emerged to become one of the promising technologies that might overcome some of the IoT limitations (security limitations, in particular). Blockchain technology is a database ledger that uses a peer-to-peer (P2P) network and stores transactions and asset registries. Blockchain can be described as a mounting list of records (i.e., blocks) with the following properties: distributed, decentralized, immutable, and shared. This paper surveyed recent security advances to overcome IoT limitations using blockchain. In this article, the blockchain attempts to overcome IoT limitations that are related to cyber security have been classified into four categories: end-to-end traceability; data privacy and anonymity; identity verification and authentication; and confidentiality, data integrity, and availability (CIA).

      <td>Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that has gained significant attention and growth in recent years. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin does not rely on a centralized authority to control the supply, distribution, and verification of the validity of transactions. Instead, Bitcoin relies on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of volunteers to distribute pending transactions and confirmed blocks, to verify transactions, and to collectively implement a replicated ledger that everyone agrees on. This P2P network is at the heart of Bitcoin and many other blockchain technologies. In this paper, we present a comparative measurement study of nodes in the Bitcoin network. We measure and analyze how many the so-called “volunteers” are in the Bitcoin P2P network by scanning the live Bitcoin network for 37 days in 2018 and compare them with the data reported by prior work in 2013~2016. This paper is motivated by the fact that Bitcoin has experienced explosive growth in terms of a number of users, transactions, value, and interest over a recent couple of years. Our investigation includes the IP addresses of Bitcoin nodes, size of the network, power law in the geographic distribution, protocol, and client versions, and network latencies and shows how today's network is different from early days. In addition, based on the observations made from the measurement study, we propose a simple distance-based peer selection rule for improved connectivity and faster data propagation. The evaluation results show that our proposed lightweight and backward-compatible peer selection rule has the potential to reduce data dissemination latency.</td>

In response, this study first introduces blockchain technology before it discusses major opportunities in the context of IPS2. For example, blockchain inherently creates a synchronized database of all transaction at each node while smart contracts allow for responsive action. However, there are also challenges. For example, large amounts of redundant data, irreversible contracts and, consequently, reduced competition. While blockchain holds much promise, more needs to be done to unlock its full potential in the context of IPS2.</td>

However, inadequate data security and trust of current IoT are seriously limiting its adoption. Blockchain, a distributed and tamper-resistant ledger, maintains consistent records of data at different locations, and has the potential to address the data security concern in IoT networks. While providing data security to the IoT, Blockchain also encounters a number of critical challenges inherent in the IoT, such as a huge number of IoT devices, non-homogeneous network structure, limited computing power, low communication bandwidth, and error-prone radio links. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on existing Blockchain technologies with an emphasis on the IoT applications. The Blockchain technologies which can potentially address the critical challenges arising from the IoT and hence suit the IoT applications are identified with potential adaptations and enhancements elaborated on the Blockchain consensus protocols and data structures. Future research directions are collated for effective integration of Blockchain into the IoT networks.</td>

Numerous sources coming from these backgrounds identify blockchains as having the potential to bring significant benefits and innovation. Blockchains promise transparent, tamper-proof and secure systems that can enable novel business solutions, especially when combined with smart contracts. This work provides a comprehensive overview of fundamental principles that underpin blockchain technologies, such as system architectures and distributed consensus algorithms. Next, we focus on blockchain solutions for the energy industry and inform the state-of-the-art by thoroughly reviewing the literature and current business cases. To our knowledge, this is one of the first academic, peer-reviewed works to provide a systematic review of blockchain activities and initiatives in the energy sector. Our study reviews 140 blockchain research projects and startups from which we construct a map of the potential and relevance of blockchains for energy applications. These initiatives were systematically classified into different groups according to the field of activity, implementation platform and consensus strategy used.1 Opportunities, potential challenges and limitations for a number of use cases are discussed, ranging from emerging peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, to decentralised marketplaces, electric vehicle charging and e-mobility. For each of these use cases, our contribution is twofold: first, in identifying the technical challenges that blockchain technology can solve for that application as well as its potential drawbacks, and second in briefly presenting the research and industrial projects and startups that are currently applying blockchain technology to that area. The paper ends with a discussion of challenges and market barriers the technology needs to overcome to get past the hype phase, prove its commercial viability and finally be adopted in the mainstream.</td>

      <td>Highlights•Identifies recent challenges facing the construction industry and recognises current attempts of exploring blockchain as part of the solution to some of these challenges.•Performs a systematic review of blockchain uses in the built environment and construction industry and identifies seven distinct areas of applications.•Introduces an extended socio-technical framework for implementation of blockchain into the construction industry including two conceptual models: the Blockchain Four-Dimensional Model, and the Blockchain Actors Model.•Compiles an extensive list of challenges and opportunities presented by blockchain across the four dimensions (technical, process, policy, social) to offer a state-of-the-art review of its current state.•Presents a decision support tool to appraise the suitability of use cases for blockchain applications and demonstrates it with three use cases.AbstractThe construction industry is facing many challenges including low productivity, poor regulation and compliance, lack of adequate collaboration and information sharing, and poor payment practices. Advances in distributed ledger technologies (DLT), also referred to as Blockchain, are increasingly investigated as one of the constituents in the digital transformation of the construction industry and its response to these challenges.The overarching aim of this study was to analyse the current state of DLT in the built environment and the construction sector with a view to developing a coherent approach to support its adoption specifically in the construction industry. Three objectives were established to achieve this: (a) to present the first state-of-the-art and literature review on DLT in the built environment and construction industry providing a consolidated view of the applications explored and potential use cases that could support disruption of the construction industry. Seven use-categories were identified: [1] Smart Energy, [2] Smart Cities &amp; the Sharing Economy, [3] Smart Government, [4] Smart Homes, [5] Intelligent Transport, [6] BIM and Construction Management, and [7] Business Models and Organisational Structures; (b) to propose a framework for implementation composed of two conceptual models (i.e. the DLT Four-Dimensional Model, and the DLT Actors Model), developed according to extended socio-technical systems theory and including four dimensions (technical, social, process and policy), to support the development of DLT-based solutions that are adequate to the challenges faced by the construction industry. The DLT Four-Dimensional Model and the DLT Actors Model contribute to improve the understanding of the concepts involved when discussing DLT applications in construction and represent flexible, adaptable and scalable knowledge constructs and foundations that can be used for various further investigations; and (c) to appraise three specific use cases (i.e. Project Bank Accounts, regulation and compliance, and a single shared-access BIM model) as potential areas for DLT through the application of a decision support tool. The results show that Project Bank Accounts (PBAs) and regulation and compliance are candidate areas for DLT applications and warrant further attention. However, for the third use case (i.e. single shared-access BIM model) DLT are still insufficiently developed at this time.The research shows that there is real potential for DLT to support digitalisation in the construction industry and enable solutions to many of its challenges. However, there needs to be further investigation of the readiness of the industry, its organisations and processes, and to evaluate what changes need to occur before implementation can be successful. Further investigations will include the development of a roadmap process incorporating the four dimensions to evaluate readiness across a series of use cases for the construction industry.</td>

More features were added to the Web including ecommerce, communication, and social media. Blockchain technology is a new layer that sits on top of the Internet, yet doesn’t need the World Wide Web—it is on par with the Web. On the long-term, blockchain has the potential to be of the same magnitude of the Web as a space — similar to what the Web gave us back in 1993–1994. (Mougayar 2016).</td>

      <td>Blockchain, as a decentralized network system, has been attracting increasing attention in recent years. In a blockchain system, there must be a consensus mechanism to ensure the distributed consensus among all parties. Such consensus mechanism may also be applied to guarantee fairness, correctness, and sustainability of such decentralized systems. In this paper, we propose a novel consensus mechanism, named Proof-of-Credibility (PoC), which is an improved version of Proof-of-Work (PoW). Compared with existing consensus mechanisms, PoC provides strong resistance to resource centralization and other malicious attacks. First, we present the Serial Mining Puzzle (SMP) to resist collusive mining. SMP guarantees that participants only get negligible advantage by parallel solving. Second, PoC considers the influence of participant credibility, which is reflected by the mining behaviour of a participant. Thus, credible participants get higher probability of winning the mining competition than incredible ones. Finally, the performance of PoC is analyzed in terms of common prefix, chain quality and power cost. Our analysis indicates that PoC is security and incentive compatible with suitable security parameter settings.\n</td>

However, critical in assessing whether blockchain can fulfill the hype of a technology characterized as ‘revolutionary’ and ‘disruptive’, is the need to ensure that blockchain design elements consider actual healthcare needs from the diverse perspectives of consumers, patients, providers, and regulators. In addition, answering the real needs of healthcare stakeholders, blockchain approaches must also be responsive to the unique challenges faced in healthcare compared to other sectors of the economy. In this sense, ensuring that a health blockchain is ‘fit-for-purpose’ is pivotal.

Technically, the most impressive feature behind the success of Ethereum is its support for a Turing complete language. On the other hand, the inherent transparency and, consequently, the lack of privacy poses a great challenge for many financial applications. In this paper, we tackle this challenge and present a smart contract for a verifiable sealed-bid auction on the Ethereum blockchain. In a nutshell, initially, the bidders submit homomorphic commitments to their sealed-bids on the contract. Subsequently, they reveal their commitments secretly to the auctioneer via a public key encryption scheme. Then, according to the auction rules, the auctioneer determines and claims the winner of the auction. Finally, we utilize interactive zero-knowledge proof protocols between the smart contract and the auctioneer to verify the correctness of such a claim. The underlying protocol of the proposed smart contract is partially privacy-preserving. To be precise, no information about the losing bids is leaked to the bidders. We provide an analysis of the proposed protocol and the smart contract design, in addition to the estimated gas costs associated with the different transactions.</td>

In this paper, we assume software practitioners who cause defects as Byzantine participants and claim that most software failures can be mitigated by viewing software development as the Byzantine Generals Problem. Consequently, we propose a test-driven incentive mechanism based on a blockchain concept to orchestrate the software development process where production is controlled by a similar infrastructure based on the working principles of blockchain.

The aim of this paper is first, to analyze the overall perspectives of blockchain technology and second, to investigate the potentials of blockchain to enable sustainable supply chains which would eliminate many shortcomings in current supply chains. This paper analyses three cases which exploited the potentials of blockchain technology with the aim of promoting sustainable sourcing from origin to consumers. The analysis compares three different cases of global supply chains, with a focus on corporate sustainability in agriculture, and manufactured goods. The results of our analysis show that blockchain has the potential to boost the supply chain sustainability, however the blockchain can’t guarantee that all supply chain stakeholders provide accurate, uniform and verifiable data. This paper provides a conceptual framework to better understand the benefits and challenges of the blockchain technology. Both academics and practitioners in companies might find this framework useful, as it outlines important lines of research in the field.</td>

      <td>With the rapid development of digital publishing field, the situation of digital copyright infringement is becoming more and more serious, and the frequent tortious cases dampen the enthusiasm of the original creators seriously. As an emerging information protection technology, blockchain has attracted extensive attention and become an important means of information protection over the years. By combining the blockchain technology with the registration protection of digital rights, the digital copyright information is stored in the block and each block is connected into the block chain in the form of time stamp by the hash pointer to the hash value of the previous block, which ensures that the digital copyright information cannot be tampered with. In the blockchain, technologies such as consensus mechanism, asymmetric encryption and intelligent contract are adopted to realize the security and credibility of information in the process of copyright registration, storage, verification, authorization and transfer, which protects digital copyright effectively.</td>

      <td>Effective Taxation System by Blockchain Technology</td>
      <td>One of the basic functions of a government is to deliver public services to citizens. Service delivery of this kind requires public expenditure. Hence, governments require resources to finance their expenditure. Although there are a number of different methods available to fund public expenditure, the most important one is taxation. However, governments incur costs when collecting taxes. It is, therefore, important for a government to ensure the efficiency of its tax collection system and to collect taxes in such a way that only minimal costs are incurred. Providing transparent, controllable, secure, and real-time information is vital in terms of ensuring the effectiveness of a tax collection system. Changes and developments in information and communication technologies have prompted the public sector to identify new ways to collect taxes. In recent years, discussions regarding the applicability of blockchain technology (or, more commonly referred to as crypto coins), for the public sector have emerged. In this study, the applicability of blockchain technology for use in a tax system is discussed. The properties and benefits of different blockchain technologies are analyzed in terms of both data and transparency. It has been concluded that blockchain technology could be applied in a number of areas to reduce the administrative tax burden and the costs associated with tax collection. This study, therefore, attempts to explain the applicability of blockchain technology in relation to taxation, and it clarifies (1) how blockchain technology represents a new approach to taxation, (2) how blockchain technology reduces tax expenditure, (3) how blockchain technology increases both transparency and accountability, (4) how tax evasion can be reduced using blockchain technology, and (5) how blockchain technology can reduce the administrative tax burden.</td>

Blockchain technology has widely been used in the finance and e-commerce industries for processing payments and smart contracts. Consensus algorithms, which are used to achieve agreement on data among distributed systems, are mostly determine by the type of blockchain, i.e. public, private, or federated, and are used for the verification and validation of transactions in such blockchain platforms. Current application of blockchain technology in the educational sector has mostly been for keeping student records, storing and validating diploma and degree certificate for academic credentials. Most of the available consensus algorithms for blockchain provide some form of reward to miners e.g. in the form of cryptocurrency. For blockchain to be adapted and used for other educational applications such as the creation of learning contents, the right consensus algorithm is needed. Since a Learning Content Creation will have little or no reward for participants and also not need “mining”, the consensus model selection will need to treat participants fairly so to not push them away. In this introductory paper, we briefly review the available consensus algorithms and provide our insight how the Blockchain framework can be adapted for instructional design and learning content creation. A proposed framework which will lead to further studies and the development of such system is discussed here.</td>

The volume and variety of data that are collected and processed in industries are ever increasing due to the widespread acceptance of modern technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, edge computing, and cloud storage. Conventional systems with centralized architecture are not designed to handle the complexity and scale of data that is processed in IIoT operations. Moreover, the threat of security and privacy breaches also increases with the growth of IIoT-connected devices. IoT devices often tend to have poor security defense systems due to low processing power, limited storage capabilities, and poor manufacturing standards. In this context, blockchain technology can help to eliminate the security vulnerabilities faced by the IIoT systems and provides extensive protection from data thefts, cyberattacks, and data corruption. Blockchain with its distributed architecture offers peer-to-peer networking and enables auditable and transparent transactions. This chapter explores the concept of IIoT and its limitations, and the need for deploying blockchain mechanisms in the IIoT paradigm. We further analyze blockchain technology and how it can reinforce IIoT systems. Existing systems of blockchain in the IIoT ecosystems and relevant use cases are also explored. As conventional systems struggle to handle the scale of data operations handled by the IIoT, blockchain has emerged as a viable solution to reinforce and reform existing systems.</td>

      <td>Emerging blockchain technology has introduced a new challenge to the distributed system research: Can Byzantine fault-tolerance protocols scale up to, for example, hundreds of nodes? In this work, we introduce HiBFT, a hierarchical Byzantine fault-tolerance protocol to address the problem. The core idea is to divide replicas into groups and exchange consensus messages among groups, thus avoiding the necessity of message broadcasting. The motivation for such approach bases on the hierarchical property of network architecture in permissioned block chains, our target deployments. HiBFT works very much in the same way as the classical Practical Byzantine Fault-Tolerance protocol. However, it replaces the concept of physical replica with a logical one that represents a replica group. As such, protocol message complexity can be reduced from \(O(N^2)\) to \(O(s^2)\) where N and s are the total number of replicas and the number of groups. Additionally, using threshold signature scheme for representing a logical group results in two important improvements: The cost of signature verification is significantly reduced at each replica; blocks can be secured more effectively in terms of signature size. Our protocol guarantees safety and liveness under partially synchronous assumption with a correctness proof. Our experiment results show that the protocol can scale up to hundred of nodes.</td>

For example, it is widely acknowledged that the Internet-of-Things (IoT) has introduced complexity to the cyberspace, however, incident responders should also realise the advantages presented by these new “Digital Witnesses” (DW) to support their investigation. Logs generated by IoT devices can help in the process of event reconstruction, but their integrity -and therefore admissibility- can be achieved only if a Chain-of-Custody (CoC) is maintained within the wider context of an on-going digital investigation. Likewise, the transition to electronic documentation improves data availability, legibility, the utility of notes, and therefore enhances the communication between stakeholders. However, without a proof of validity, these data could be falsified. For example, in an application area such as eHealth, there is a requirement to maintain various existing (and new) rules and regulations concerning authorship, auditing, and the integrity of medical records. Lacking data control could lead to system abuse, fraud and severe compromise of service quality. These concerns can be resolved by implementing an online CoC. In this paper, we discuss the value and means of utilising Blockchain in modern systems to support DFIR. we demonstrate the value of Blockchain to improve the implementation of Digital Forensic Models and discuss why law enforcement and incident responders need to understand Blockchain technology. Furthermore, the admissibility of a Digital Evidence to a Court of Law requires chronological documentation. Hence, we discuss how the CoC can be sustained based on a distributed ledger. Finally, we provide a practical scenario related to eHealth to demonstrate the value of this approach to introduce forensic readiness to computer systems and enable better Police interventions.</td>

Together with relatively new concepts such as Open Data, blockchain stands a chance to be practically utilised in different socio-economic establishments. The synthesis of blockchain and Open Data presently opens up requisite implementation of Freedom of Information (FoI) bills which many countries around the world have enacted into laws.

Permissioned blockchain solutions adopt more efficient consensus algorithms and smart contracts. There are many smart-contract solutions exists (such as, etherium, IBM blockchain, hyperledger fabric), however, much of them mainly follow traditional access control models. A role-based access control model provides controlled access of resources to members. This research work presents an extended usage control model known as DistU (Distributed Usage Control). DistU is proposed to capture all possible access control models required by a business for permissioned blockchain frameworks. DistU can monitor a resource continuously during the operation and update the attributes accordingly, performing different actions, such as denying or revoking permissions. We believe that the proposed DistU usage control model can provide a fine-grained control for blockchain resource management. The paper also contributes to provide a protoype implementation of fine-grained permission model on Hyperledger Fabric. The reason of selecting Fabric for this research is that, it is the first execute-order achitecture blockchain that provides a platform to develop general business applciations.

      <td>Markov processes in blockchain systems</td>
      <td>In this paper, we develop a more general framework of block-structured Markov processes in the queueing study of blockchain systems, which can provide analysis both for the stationary performance measures and for the sojourn time of any transaction or block. In addition, an original aim of this paper is to generalize the two-stage batch-service queueing model studied in Li et al. (Blockchain queue theory. In: International conference on computational social networks. Springer: New York; 2018. p. 25–40) both “from exponential to phase-type” service times and “from Poisson to MAP” transaction arrivals. Note that the MAP transaction arrivals and the two stages of PH service times make our blockchain queue more suitable to various practical conditions of blockchain systems with crucial factors, for example, the mining processes, the block generations, the blockchain building and so forth. For such a more general blockchain queueing model, we focus on two basic research aspects: (1) using the matrix-geometric solution, we first obtain a sufficient stable condition of the blockchain system. Then, we provide simple expressions for the average stationary number of transactions in the queueing waiting room and the average stationary number of transactions in the block. (2) However, on comparing with Li et al. (2018), analysis of the transaction–confirmation time becomes very difficult and challenging due to the complicated blockchain structure. To overcome the difficulties, we develop a computational technique of the first passage times by means of both the PH distributions of infinite sizes and the RG factorizations. Finally, we hope that the methodology and results given in this paper will open a new avenue to queueing analysis of more general blockchain systems in practice and can motivate a series of promising future research on development of blockchain technologies.</td>

Industry 4.0 (I4.0) extends further the IIoT model with the inclusion of robotics and automation, whereas Hospital 4.0 (H4.0) is the application of the I4.0 paradigm to the healthcare sector. H4.0 relies on cyber-physical systems managing several devices and software components. and the exchange of a huge amount of sensible data that includes medical records. Medical records can be much more valuable to criminals than financial data, indeed the control of medical data allows criminals to plan and realize different frauds, that the victims may identify only too late. Furthermore, the complexity of a typical H4.0 cyber-physical system makes healthcare records particularly vulnerable. Blockchain is today an emerging technology for the management of data that may avoid or mitigate the impact of threats related to data storage and management, in general, and to the administration, in particular, of healthcare records. The blockchain technology relies on cryptography and distributed consensus to guarantee data integrity, accountability and security. The exploitation of such technology is considered in this chapter, showing the advantages when used in a H4.0 scenario.</td>

      <td>\nBlockchain as a Service for the Internet of Things is an emerging topic in the blockchain research and industrial community, especially relating to increased system consistency, security, and privacy. Blockchains represent highly distributed and autonomous decision-making systems with distributed data and process management. Internet of Things systems share these characteristics, while also bringing the cyber-physical dimension and machine-to-machine interaction concept to the ecosystem of devices and users. Blockchain infrastructure setup and smart contract prototyping are cumbersome tasks. Onboarding an existing system to a blockchain network takes a significant amount of time and manual effort, and incorporating business logic requires a series of complex steps. For IoT systems, these task needs to be carried out having in mind the typical characteristics of such systems: low hardware, storage, and networking capabilities and high node churn and transaction volume. Moreover, these tasks need to be semi to fully automated in terms of workflows that support easy-to-use integration mechanisms for onboarding of diverse IoT infrastructures and on-demand business logic generation. In this paper, we present a Hyperledger Fabric-based Blockchain as a Service for addressing the identified challenges. Specifically, the framework is tailored to answer to specific requirements of IoT systems through three major services: Hyperledger Fabric Infrastructure Configuration Generator, Hyperledger Fabric Chaincode Builder and Hyperledger Fabric Operator Modules.</td>

      <td>With the breakthroughs in sensor technology and internet of things, Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) is developing into a new generation. The technical challenges of current VANET are decentralized architecture deployment and privacy protection. Since the blockchain owns the characteristics of being decentralized, distributed, collective maintenance and non-tampering, this paper designs a novel decentralized architecture using blockchain technology, which is called blockchain-based VANET. The blockchain-based VANET involves four major stages: blockchain set-up, registration of vehicles, SBMs upload, and blockchain record. It can effectively address the problems of centralization and mutual distrust between entities in current VANET. For protecting identity and location privacy, we propose UGG, IPP and LPP algorithms with the way of dynamic threshold encryption and k-anonymity unity in the stage of SBMs upload of blockchain-based VANET. To quantify the availability of k-anonymity unity, we propose two indicators: connectivity and average distance. Extensive simulations have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of blockchain-based VANET. We analyze the simulation results from four aspects: system time, average distance, connectivity, and privacy leakage. The simulation results show that our proposed architecture performs better in terms of processing time than current architectures. Furthermore, our proposed architecture shows its superior in the aspect of protecting identity and location privacy.</td>

      <td>Proof-of-Work blockchain, despite its numerous benefits, is still not an entirely secure technology due to the existence of Selfish Mining (SM) strategies that can disrupt the system and its mining economy. While the effect of SM has been studied mostly in a two-miners scenario, it has not been investigated in a more practical context where there are multiple malicious miners individually performing SM. To fill this gap, we carry out an empirical study that separately accounts for different numbers of SM miners (who always perform SM) and strategic miners (who choose either SM or Nakamoto’s mining protocol depending on which maximises their individual mining reward). Our result shows that SM is generally more effective as the number of SM miners increases, however its effectiveness does not vary in the presence of a large number of strategic miners. Under specific mining power distributions, we also demonstrate that multiple miners can perform SM and simultaneously gain higher mining rewards than they should. Surprisingly, we also show that the more strategic miners there are, the more robust the systems become. Since blockchain miners should naturally be seen as self-interested strategic miners, our findings encourage blockchain system developers and engineers to attract as many miners as possible to prevent SM and similar behaviour.</td>

Further, due to poll violence and waiting in the long queues to cast their votes, numbers of common citizens avoid the voting process completely in order to evade the chaos. In order to reduce these issues or to increase the voting rate, number of smart based or IoT enabled voting applications has been projected by various authors. However, IoT devices can be easily compromised or hacked by the experts (intruders) in order to gain their own access. Therefore, to ensure an enhanced secure and transparent polling process, Blockchain plays a vital role in ensuring the legit votes and their counting without their manipulation in any way. It is also needed in today’s times where the world is available to people in their IoT or smart devices to also give them the opportunity to register their votes hassle free via their smart devices without having to worry about the system getting hacked. Therefore, in this paper, the proposed layout will be based on an enhanced security through Blockchain in E-voting application using IoT devices where the user will create an account with proper verification done via voter id and other biometric methods on a smart device. Every transaction done via this account which in this case will be registering vote will be validated by a miner. The proposed Blockchain mechanism for E-polling using IoT devices is again validated and verified through several parameters such as response time, resource utilization and request processed.\n</td>

      <td>A Systematic Review for Enabling of Develop a Blockchain Technology in Healthcare Application: Taxonomy, Substantially Analysis, Motivations, Challenges, Recommendations and Future Direction</td>
      <td>Blockchain in healthcare applications requires robust security and privacy mechanism for high-level authentication, interoperability and medical records sharing to comply with the strict legal requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. Blockchain technology in the healthcare industry has received considerable research attention in recent years. This study conducts a review to substantially analyse and map the research landscape of current technologies, mainly the use of blockchain in healthcare applications, into a coherent taxonomy. The present study systematically searches all relevant research articles on blockchain in healthcare applications in three accessible databases, namely, ScienceDirect, IEEE and Web of Science, by using the defined keywords ‘blockchain’, ‘healthcare’ and ‘electronic health records’ and their variations. The final set of collected articles related to the use of blockchain in healthcare application is divided into three categories. The first category includes articles (i.e. 43/58 scientific articles) that attempted to develop and design healthcare applications integrating blockchain, particularly those on new architecture, system designs, framework, scheme, model, platform, approach, protocol and algorithm. The second category includes studies (i.e., 6/58 scientific articles) that attempted to evaluate and analyse the adoption of blockchain in the healthcare system. Finally, the third category comprises review and survey articles (i.e., 6/58 scientific articles) related to the integration of blockchain into healthcare applications. The final articles for review are discussed on the basis of five aspects: (1) year of publication, (2) nationality of authors, (3) publishing house or journal, (4) purpose of using blockchain in health applications and the corresponding contributions and (5) problem types and proposed solutions. Additionally, this study provides identified motivations, open challenges and recommendations on the use of blockchain in healthcare applications. The current research contributes to the literature by providing a detailed review of feasible alternatives and identifying the research gaps. Accordingly, researchers and developers are provided with appealing opportunities to further develop decentralised healthcare applications through a comprehensive discussion of about the importance of blockchain and its integration into various healthcare applications.</td>

      <td>A Simple Survey for Supply Chain Finance Risk Management with Applications of Blockchain</td>
      <td>Supply chain finance (SCF) is an important solution that optimizes cash flow in order to lower financing costs and improve business efficiency especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Risk management is the essential requirement of SCF. In recent years, the digital economy is developing rapidly worldwide and holds huge potential for entrepreneurs and SMEs. In the digital economy scenario, digitalization of supply chains is also becoming increasingly dynamic. Blockchain technology is regarded as a potential means of digitalization for supply chains and could play an important role in supply chain finance risk management. This paper first reviews the literature of supply chain finance risk management and provides some disadvantages of traditional supply chain finance risk management. Then we survey the new perspective for supply chain finance risk management based on blockchain technology. In particular, blockchain can increase the information transparency of the supply chain, thereby reducing the credit risk of SMEs financing and the operational risk in SCF. Categorization and analysis of the literature, it provides an important perspective for future research of supply chain finance risk management based on blockchain technology in the era of digital economy.</td>

      <td>Sensor-based health data collection, remote access to health data to render real-time advice have been the key advantages of smart and remote healthcare. Such health monitoring and support are getting immensely popular among both patients and doctors as it does not require physical movement which is always not possible for elderly people who lives mostly alone in current socio-economic situations. Healthcare Informatics plays a key role in such circumstances. The huge amount of raw data emanating from sensors needs to be processed applying machine learning and deep learning algorithms for useful information extraction to develop an intelligent knowledge base for providing an appropriate solution as and when required. The real challenge lies in data storage and retrieval preserving security, privacy, reliability and availability requirements. Health data saved in Electronic medical record (EMR) is generally saved in a client-server database where central coordinator does access control like create, access, update, or delete of health records. But in smart and remote healthcare supported by enabling technologies such as Sensors, Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud, Deep learning, Big data, etc. EMR needs to be accessed in a distributed manner among multiple stakeholders involved such as hospitals, doctors, research labs, patients’ relatives, insurance provider, etc. Hence, it is to be ensured that health data be protected from unauthorized access specifically to maintain data integrity using advanced distributed security techniques such as blockchain.\n</td>

The topic is of relevance as the acquisition of knowledge and its conversion into dynamic capabilities provides enterprises with the possibility to go through digital transition and transform the acquired knowledge into modified business models, innovative products, and upgraded services. Since the first crafting of absorptive capacity theory in the beginning of 1990s, there has been ample research on its application in medium and large companies. The contribution of this study is that it assesses the concept of absorptive capacity and its impact on firm performance in start-ups. The methodological approach involves quantitative data analysis using a survey applied to a sample of 44 blockchain start-ups measuring the following variables: acquisition, assimilation, transformation, and exploitation. We analyzed firm performance through a variety of concepts previously tested in other studies, sales growth, profit growth, growth in market share, and growth in return on capital, and found a positive relationship between AC and firm performance in blockchain start-ups. However, based on our findings, we cannot conclude that blockchain start-ups are more successful because of their AC. Therefore, we suggest further examination of items more specific to the demands of an increasingly digital economy.</td>

      <td>Difficulty of Decentralized Structure Due to Rational User Behavior on Blockchain</td>
      <td>\nBlockchain is an autonomous decentralized system, the operation of which depends on the motivation of the users who provide the nodes for managing the accurate distributed ledger. For the management of an accurate ledger, a strong limitation exists that requires a large amount of storage, and it binds the node specifications to force users to perform rational management on the network. These are designed into the system as invisible rules that are not described in the program. Therefore, monitoring the dynamism of nodes on the network can aid in understanding the potential system mechanisms. In this study, by monitoring Bitcoin and Ethereum over a long comparative period of 455 days as a system based on the main blockchains actually used, we demonstrate that it is difficult to balance the distributed structure owing to the rational behavior of users. We empirically provide the following evidence: (1) the node density of a specific hosting region increases; and (2) a local hosting region with less than 1% of the total nodes closes. We conclude that this is a security risk problem that results in a weak network structure, and discuss possible solutions.</td>

      <td>Initial coin offerings are a new way for blockchain startups to finance project development by issuing coins or tokens in exchange for fiat money or Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. In this article, we start from the current distinction between different types of tokens and argue that it can create confusion and should be at least partially abandoned. We believe that the conceptual difference between a currency token and a tradable utility token is just the dimension of the crypto environment in which the token is spent. More specifically, ‘utility tokens’ combine the customer payment mechanism with the utility component and, when tradable on a secondary market, the investment one. We argue that they blur the traditional distinctions between currencies, financial assets and consumption goods. Moreover, we stress the increasing importance of online crypto exchanges. Recently some exchanges have also taken up the role of trusted intermediaries and staked their reputation on token offerings, which are termed initial exchange offerings and have gained in popularity. We therefore argue that the crypto market increasingly looks like a segment of the capital market and behaves as such. Given that tokens have a clear investment component, we show that they are tradable securities under the Prospectus Regulation. We compare the European securities regulation with its US counterpart and focus on prospectus exemptions, highlighting the great differences between Europe and the US which make Europe less amicable to blockchain startups.</td>

      <td>\nBlockchain is a decentralized transaction and data management technology developed first for Bitcoin cryptocurrency. The interest in Blockchain technology has been increasing since the idea was presented in 2008. The reasons for all the interest around Blockchain comes from its decentralized nature, while providing security, anonymity and data integrity. All these features without any third-party organization in control of the transactions, therefore creating interesting research areas. The Blockchain is a versatile technology, which can be implemented in a vast list of industries and maybe change completely the way we approach some of their use cases. In this paper, we will present some of the most relevant and recent Blockchain projects, classifying them by their main purpose or value proposition. Additionally, we describe the main technical and legal challenges, which may prevent this technology from a more rapid and wider use.</td>

      <td>Geoengineering and the blockchain: Coordinating Carbon Dioxide Removal and Solar Radiation Management to tackle future emissions</td>
      <td>Geoengineering is a proposed response to anthropogenic global warming (AGW). Conventionally it consists of two strands: Solar Radiation Management (SRM), which is fast-acting, incomplete but inexpensive, and Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR), which is slower acting, more expensive, and comprehensive. Pairing SRM and CDR offers a contractually complete solution for future emissions if effectively-scaled and coordinated. SRM offsets warming, while CDR takes effect.We suggest coordination using a blockchain, i.e. smart contracts and a distributed ledger. Specifically, we integrate CDR futures with time and volume-matched SRM orders, to address emissions contractually before release. This provides an economically and environmentally proportionate solution to CO2 emissions at the wellhead, with robust contractual transparency, and minimal overhead cost.Our proposal offers a ‘polluter pays’ implementation of Long &amp; Shepherds SRM ‘bridge’ concept. This ‘polluter geoengineers’ approach mandates and verifies emissions-linked payments with minimal friction, delay, or cost. Finally, we compare alternative market designs against this proposal, finding that this proposal offers several advantages. We conclude that blockchain implementation of the ‘polluter geoengineers’ approach is attractive and feasible for larger wellhead contracts. We also identify a handful of advantages and disadvantages that merit further study.</td>

In order to analyze deeply the results of the survey, indicators of the knowledge factor and the usage factor were developed to assess knowledge and usage of BC respectively. The main findings point out to the popular internet portals and conversations with other people as the main sources of information on BC for students. Students are less likely to obtain their information from university classes and lectures, television, radio, and other media. The percentage of active BC users almost doubles the percentage of respondents having specialized knowledge, therefore the relationship between knowledge and usage of BC is rather weak. Traditional banking and trade are the most frequently indicated areas of BC applications by the respondents. The conducted research also shows that BC may be perceived as a tool for social/technology evolution and revolution. The survey results have important implications for universities as they confirm that university curricula are not updated sufficiently quickly to keep up with the emerging technologies.</td>

      <td>Weaknesses in investor control over their investments and in warehousing systemic risk in modern Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI) are the result of a combination of market failures and of structural flaws deeply ingrained in modern financial markets. Yet the utility of complex FMI comprising long custodial chains and large global Central Counterparties (CCPs) for the operation of modern markets is not seriously disputed. The change in the technology paradigm with the introduction of DLT systems for securities and derivatives FMI can increase investor control, the efficiency of risk management and, to some extent, augment the distribution of systemic risk. It can thus create a more diverse and resilient financial ecosystem. This cross-disciplinary paper identifies a multitude of reasons that favour a paradigm shift in FMI technology. It also sketches a comprehensive blockchain-based framework for the development of permission-based platforms for derivatives clearing and settlement and the handling of liquidity shortages within DLT systems. Arguably, the impact of technological change should lead to a reduction of industry rents for the benefit of end investors and of the end users of finance (entrepreneurs and businesses) enhancing market welfare. Therefore, the use of blockchain technology in FMI can transform the structure and future direction of the financial services industry as a whole.</td>

      <td>Revisiting Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance Through Blockchain Technologies</td>
      <td>The connection between Byzantine fault tolerance and cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, may not be apparent immediately. Byzantine fault tolerance is intimately linked to engineering and design challenges of developing long-running and safety-critical technical systems. Its origins can be traced back to the question of how to deal with faulty sensors in distributed systems and the fundamental insight that majority voting schemes may be insufficient to guarantee correctness if arbitrary, or so-called Byzantine failures, can occur. However, achieving resilience against Byzantine failures has its price, both in terms of the redundancy required within a system and the incurred communication overhead. Together with the complexity of correctly implementing Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocols, it may help to explain why BFT systems have not yet been widely deployed in practice, even though practical designs exist for almost 20 years. On the other hand, asking anyone about Bitcoin or blockchain 10 years ago would have only raised quizzical looks. Since then, the ecosphere surrounding blockchain technologies has grown from the pseudonymously published proposal for a peer-to-peer electronic cash system into a multi-billion-dollar industry. At the heart of this success story lies not only the technical innovations presented by Bitcoin but a colorful and diverse community that has succeeded in bridging gaps and bringing together various disciplines from academia and industry alike. Bitcoin reinvigorated interest in the topic of BFT as it was arguably the first system that achieved a practical form of Byzantine fault tolerance with a large and changing number of participants. Research into the fundamental principles and mechanisms behind the underlying blockchain technology of Bitcoin has since helped advance the field and state of the art regarding BFT protocols. This chapter will outline how these modern blockchain technologies relate to the field of Byzantine fault tolerance and outline advantages and disadvantages in their design decisions and fundamental assumptions. Thereby, we highlight that Byzantine fault tolerance should be considered a practical and fundamental building block for modern long-running and safety critical systems and that the principles, mechanisms, and blockchain technologies themselves could help improve the security and quality of such systems.</td>

      <td>Blockchain and Its Potential Applications in Food Supply Chain Management in Ecuador</td>
      <td>In recent years, attention has been directed to the problem of food loss and waste. On the one hand, there is an increasing demand for higher quality fresh produce and products. On the other hand, studies suggest that at least one-third of food production is lost along its supply chain. The most crucial part is constituted by suppliers-retailers-consumers, since it presents the highest percentages of loss or waste. Several works in the literature suggest that the exchange of information is one of the most important means to reduce waste. Shared information can improve decisions regarding the quantity in supplier’s orders and vendor’s inventory allocation among retailers. Based on these needs, the Blockchain technology, developed in recent years to generate secure transactions on different sectors, has the characteristics of decentralization, information security, and reliability. If this technology can be applied as an underlying basis of a supply chain, it could improve exchanges of information and products among all parts of the system. In this context, the current article presents a systematic review on Blockchain in food supply chain management (FSCM) in Ecuador, its main contributions, and potential benefits. Findings indicate that Blockchain in FSCM is a recent research area whose importance is rapidly growing. However, little is known about Ecuadorian studies applying Blockchain. Additionally, no studies have reported the combination of Blockchain and Internet of Things technologies, one of the most prominent and complementary applications of Blockchain.</td>

First, due to the large chains of intermediaries in the current securities models, transaction costs are high and shareholder votes and other information are not always correctly transmitted between shareholders and issuers. Recent cases including DNick Holding and T. Rowe Price show the ‘absurdness’ of the current systems. The Shareholder Rights Directive II addresses these problems and the Implementing Regulation already hints at modern technologies to increase the transparency and verifiability of shareholder engagement. Next, the current shareholder engagement system enables different opportunities for different types of shareholders, creating inequalities and hindering shareholder democracy. The solution to these substantial problems lies in a state-of-the-art technology: in this contribution we argue that blockchain technology can solve these current inefficiencies that shareholders and companies face. Using a permissioned blockchain, information can be stored in a verifiable and immutable way, with a consensus mechanism tailored to its purpose. The large amount of initiatives and prototypes of blockchain proxy voting and trading, including the legislative initiatives that were initiated in the past 2 years, show the merits of using this state-of-the-art technology. The Europe Union should incorporate this technology in its legislation, like the CSD regulation, for remaining technology-proof in this globalized market.</td>

Although blockchain emerged in the Internet commerce sector as an immutable and decentralized ledger system, it can now be seen as a framework for autonomous decentralized data processing which enforces a flat and open-access network. The primary security threat in Blockchain would be a compromise or fallacy in the Consensus mechanism. The Proof of concept (PoX) approach used in Blockchains has elegantly emulated the leader-election function required in a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocol to simulate the block proposal process. Proof of work (PoW), the consensus mechanism that the Bitcoin protocol employed paved the way for blockchain as a viable DLT for commerce on the internet. Many “alt-coins” subsequently came up, however PoW has saturated with the explosion of popularity of the crypto currency and other alt-coins have achieved sub-optimal solutions. There is the looming “51% attack” for resource pricing algorithms and various other attacks such as Bribe attacks, Sybil attacks and the Nothing-at-stake attack for the other alternate consensus mechanisms. The novel PoStack algorithm is a gamification of the node mining process, which enforces a simple notion: a node’s chance of mining crypto currency is proportional to its belief in a node that no one else believes in. The protocol has modest computational and financial needs, which reduces the barrier to entry.</td>

      <td>Blockchain Driven Platform for Energy Distribution in a Microgrid</td>
      <td>\n\n\nEver since the Digital Revolution, the World population has been growing at an ever-increasing rate, with the last billion being amassed in only 9 years. The increase in population only exacerbates the current challenge of meeting peak-energy demands while accommodating an increasing amount of distributed energy resources such as solar panels. Utilities must learn how to encourage energy-efficient practices to reduce demand, as well as how to effectively coordinate interaction between consumers, renewable-energy sources, and the grid. With earnings currently communicated on monthly billing cycles, existing solutions such as net-metering, feed-in-tariffs and demand response are neither transparent nor resolute enough. They are also not flexible enough to accommodate community shared energy resources. This paper aims to bridge this gap by developing a secure energy-distribution model for multi-family apartment buildings and neighborhoods that share a solar panel array. EOSIO smart contracts will be used to transparently and dynamically distribute energy using tokens. At each time-step, the residents are allocated tokens worth a fair portion of total energy production minus their unit’s consumption. Excess energy is sold to neighbors at just below the retail rate, instead of back to the grid at much lower cogeneration rates, thus constantly incentivizing efficiency and energy sharing. This will pave the way towards community scale solar and even communal food and water resources where residents can equitably share in both costs and profits. The model presented in the paper was validated through the award winning entries in the 2019 EOSIO Hackathon as well as the Virginia Tech’s grand prize winning entry in the 2019 Solar Decathlon Design Challenge.</td>

Various application scenarios emerge, such as include data centers, storage in wireless networks and peer-to-peer storage systems. Storing data by using code, such as an erasure code, calls for less redundancy compared with simple replication in terms of reliability. Nevertheless, since data fragments are periodically replaced when some nodes fail, a key acute question is how to generate encoded data fragments in a distributed way when transferring as little data as possible over the network. For a coded system, a new node to repair from a node failure is to download subsets of data from some surviving nodes, reconstructs some lost coded blocks by using the downloaded fragments, and stores them at the new node. This procedure is not optimal. In this paper, we introduce blockchain to protect distributed data in terms of node failure and etc. We show that blockchain can significantly improve the integrity and credibility in distributed file storage systems. Furthermore, we harvest theory discovery of blockchain in distributed file storage system.</td>

Healthcare organizations around the world are transforming themselves into more efficient, coordinated and user-centered systems through various multimedia techniques. However, the management of huge amount data such as reports and images of every person leads to increase the human efforts and security risks. In order to overcome these issues, IoT in healthcare enhances the quality of patients care and reduce the cost by allocating the medical resources in an efficient way.

      <td>Securing Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) Using Private Blockchain Network</td>
      <td>A key initiative taken by Government of India in response to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Digital India” move is the formation of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem for smart healthcare. Any security flaw occurring during authentication with a centralized environment affects the connectivity of devices in the network and the transaction of data in IoT. As a solution, Blockchain technology emerges to use in IoT network for the betterment. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is the collection of medical devices and applications that connect to healthcare IT systems. In IoMT environment, a private Blockchain network is created containing all the participants of a hospital including doctors, lab technicians, patients and clinical laboratories etc., There exists no necessity to carry the report by the patients during every visit, as the data is already available in the network. The data is completely decentralized to avoid failure, data loss and to provide faster recovery. Whenever a change is attempted by a third person in the database, a notification is sent to all the members of the group. Since this is a private Blockchain, it requires an additional level of authentication. Whenever any new person requires being a part of the network a document for proof is provided. The data is transparent, so any modification done by any member of the group will get notified to everyone. An additional level security can be provided for data transfer based upon the mutually agreed security parameter and any modification in database is accepted upon approval of all members. In addition, when a hospital is not able to provide any sophisticated treatment to the patient due to lack of medical facilities, recommendation is sent to the patient; thereby new hospital added to the private network after successful authentication to access patient’s record. To access record, quantum key may be generated and distributed across the network.\n</td>

In this paper, we developed a consortium blockchain network to evaluate various machine learning models for a given malware dataset. A reward is offered using smart contracts as an incentive to the competitors for their work by allowing them to submit solutions through training with selected machine learning models in a secure and trustworthy manner. The analysis of datasets by competitors helps various organizations in the network to enhance or boost their current malware detection or defense tools. The decentralized network provides transparency, enhances security and reduces the cost in managing all relevant data by eliminating third parties.

Smart homes consist of home appliances and devices that communicate with each other to address the needs of the residents. These appliances generate, share and consume lots of data which are private and sometimes safety critical to the residents. Managing them is a challenging task. The current frameworks for managing home appliances are centralized in nature. Such frameworks force smart home residents to trust the service providers or a third party. These frameworks are also prone to hacking, compromise of data and a single point of failure. Availability of services can also never be guaranteed with such frameworks. Technologies such as blockchain and smart contracts can help to manage these appliances. In this paper, we study the scope of blockchain technology in smart homes. We propose, implement and evaluate a blockchain based approach using Proof-of-Authority as the consensus mechanism for managing appliances in smart homes. In addition, we compare the performance of our system with the traditional Proof-of-Work based system.\n\n</td>

It empowers the design of decentralized transactions, smart contracts, and intelligent assets that can be managed over internet. It formulates the revolutionary decision-making governance systems with more egalitarian users and autonomous organizations that can control over Internet without any third-party involved.

The IoT applications are also distributed in nature and the blockchain technology could be an imminent factor in deciding how the IoT connected devices communicate with each other. With the aid of blockchain, the security of IoT devices can be decentralized to a great extent thereby, eliminating the possibility of threats that hover around it at present.

After briefly reviewing the literature regarding blockchain technology, smart contracts, and integration of the BIM and blockchain, a blockchain network using Hyperledger fabric is proposed and tested to govern a sample construction project. The proposed framework does not utilize the cryptocurrency aspect of the blockchain as the payment form. Instead, it discusses the integration of the current banking system and the use of fiat currencies in transactions. The results show that blockchain is a viable system for governing construction project contracts by automating the consequences of each transaction and maintaining a tamper proof record of project progress, which would be valuable in any kind of dispute resolution. The blockchain network developed in this study implements the smart contract as its network operation logic. As a result, the notion of having to translate all the traditional contract clauses to the computer program is shown to be unnecessary and to some extent not suitable for construction, due to the complexity, fluidity, and high uncertainties involved in each project.\n</td>

Although GitHub currently hosts more than six thousand active Blockchain software (BCS) projects, few software engineering researchers have investigated these projects and their contributors. Although the number of BCS projects is growing rapidly, the motivations, challenges, and needs of BCS developers remain a puzzle. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to understand the motivations, challenges, and needs of BCS developers and analyze the differences between BCS and non-BCS development. On this goal, we sent an online survey to 1,604 active BCS developers identified by mining the GitHub repositories of 145 popular BCS projects. The survey received 156 responses that met our criteria for analysis. The results suggest that the majority of the BCS developers are experienced in non-BCS development and are primarily motivated by the ideology of creating a decentralized financial system. Although most of the BCS projects are Open Source Software (OSS) projects by nature, more than 93% of our respondents found BCS development somewhat different from a non-BCS development as BCS projects have higher emphasis on security and reliability than most of the non-BCS projects. Other differences include: higher costs of defects, decentralized and hostile environment, technological complexity, and difficulty in upgrading the software after release. These differences were also the primary sources of challenges to them. Software development tools that are tuned for non-BCS development are inadequate for BCS and the ecosystem needs an array of new or improved tools, such as: customized IDE for BCS development tasks, debuggers for smart-contracts, testing support, easily deployable simulators, and BCS domain specific design notations.</td>

The blockchain network was originated from the Internet financial sector as a decentralized, immutable ledger system for transactional data ordering. Nowadays, it is envisioned as a powerful backbone/framework for decentralized data processing and data-driven self-organization in flat, open-access networks. In particular, the plausible characteristics of decentralization, immutability, and self-organization are primarily owing to the unique decentralized consensus mechanisms introduced by blockchain networks. This survey is motivated by the lack of a comprehensive literature review on the development of decentralized consensus mechanisms in blockchain networks. In this paper, we provide a systematic vision of the organization of blockchain networks. By emphasizing the unique characteristics of decentralized consensus in blockchain networks, our in-depth review of the state-of-the-art consensus protocols is focused on both the perspective of distributed consensus system design and the perspective of incentive mechanism design. From a game-theoretic point of view, we also provide a thorough review of the strategy adopted for self-organization by the individual nodes in the blockchain backbone networks. Consequently, we provide a comprehensive survey of the emerging applications of blockchain networks in a broad area of telecommunication. We highlight our special interest in how the consensus mechanisms impact these applications.

Finally we provide a detailed analysis of challenges in leveraging each of the enablers in I4.0, evidencing possible roadblocks to be overcome and pointing at possible future directions of research. Our goal is to provide a reference for the experts in some of the technological fields involved, for a reconnaissance of integration and hybridization possibilities with other fields in the endeavor of I4.0, as well as for the laymen, for a high-level grasp of the variety (and often deep history) of the scientific research backing I4.0.</td>

      <td>Understanding the motivations, challenges and needs of Blockchain software developers: a survey</td>
      <td>The blockchain technology has potential applications in various areas such as smart-contracts, Internet of Things (IoT), land registry, supply chain management, storing medical data, and identity management. Although GitHub currently hosts more than six thousand active Blockchain software (BCS) projects, few software engineering researchers have investigated these projects and their contributors. Although the number of BCS projects is growing rapidly, the motivations, challenges, and needs of BCS developers remain a puzzle. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to understand the motivations, challenges, and needs of BCS developers and analyze the differences between BCS and non-BCS development. On this goal, we sent an online survey to 1,604 active BCS developers identified by mining the GitHub repositories of 145 popular BCS projects. The survey received 156 responses that met our criteria for analysis. The results suggest that the majority of the BCS developers are experienced in non-BCS development and are primarily motivated by the ideology of creating a decentralized financial system. Although most of the BCS projects are Open Source Software (OSS) projects by nature, more than 93% of our respondents found BCS development somewhat different from a non-BCS development as BCS projects have higher emphasis on security and reliability than most of the non-BCS projects. Other differences include: higher costs of defects, decentralized and hostile environment, technological complexity, and difficulty in upgrading the software after release. These differences were also the primary sources of challenges to them. Software development tools that are tuned for non-BCS development are inadequate for BCS and the ecosystem needs an array of new or improved tools, such as: customized IDE for BCS development tasks, debuggers for smart-contracts, testing support, easily deployable simulators, and BCS domain specific design notations.</td>

However, it is still necessary to determine what approach is the best for each type of application. To find how distributed ledgers solve existing problems, this study looks for blockchain frameworks in the academic world. Identifying the existing frameworks can demonstrate where the interest in the technology exists and where it can be missing. This study encountered several blockchain frameworks in development. However, there are few references to operational needs, testing, and deploy of the technology. With the widespread use of the technology, either integrating with pre-existing solutions, replacing legacy systems, or new implementations, the need for testing, deploying, exploration, and maintenance is expected to intensify.</td>

The entire life cycle of a file exchange, including file registration, access request and key distribution, is recorded and traceable via the smart contract. Moreover, when one party raises a dispute, the smart contract can be used to identify the dishonest party without compromising the file's confidentiality.The proposed protocol provides a simple, novel, yet efficient approach to exchange files with support for data access auditability between companies involved in a private consortium with no incentive to share files outside of the protocol. We implemented the protocol in Solidity, deployed it on a private Ethereum blockchain, and validated it within the use case of a decentralized workflow.</td>

The MHC comprises an online smart contract and an offline traditional legal contract. where the two are immutably linked.Secure peer-to-peer financial transactions, transparency, and cost accounting are automated by the smart contract, and legal issues or disputes are carried out by civil courts.

      <td>\nAbstract:  The Selfdestruct function is provided by Ethereum smart contracts to destroy\na contract on the blockchain system. However, it is a double-edged sword for\ndevelopers. On the one hand, using Selfdestruct function enables developers to\nremove smart contracts (SC) from Ethereum and transfers Ethers when emergency\nsituations happen, e.g. being attacked. On the other hand, this function can\nincrease the complexity for the development and open an attack vector for\nattackers. To better understand the reasons why SC developers include or\nexclude the Selfdestruct function in their contracts, we conducted an online\nsurvey to collect feedback from them and summarize the key reasons. Their\nfeedback shows that 66.67% of the developers will deploy an updated contract to\nthe Ethereum after destructing the old contract. According to this information,\nwe propose a method to find the self-destruct contracts (also called\npredecessor contracts) and their updated version (successor contracts) by\ncomputing the code similarity. By analyzing the difference between the\npredecessor contracts and their successor contracts, we found six reasons that\nled to the death of the contracts; three of them (i.e., Unmatched ERC20 Token,\nConfusing Contract and Limits of Permission) might affect the life span of\ncontracts. We developed a tool named LifeScope to detect these problems.\nLifeScope reports 0 false positives or negatives in detecting Unmatched ERC20\nToken and Confusing Contract. In terms of Limits of Permission, LifeScope\nachieves 85.67% of F-measure and 0.9014 of AUC. According to the feedback of\ndevelopers who exclude Selfdestruct functions, we propose suggestions to help\ndevelopers use Selfdestruct functions in Ethereum smart contracts better.\n\n</td>

However, many of these blockchain systems suffer from serious\nshortcomings related to their performance and security, which need to be\naddressed before any wide-scale adoption can be achieved. A crucial component\nof any blockchain system is its underlying consensus algorithm, which in many\nways, determines its performance and security.

Blockchain technology has emerged a solution for managing MEC\nservices, with consensus protocols and data integrity checks that enable\ntransparent and efficient distributed decision-making. In addition to\ntransparency, the benefits from a security point of view are evident.\nNonetheless, blockchain technology faces significant challenges in terms of\nscalability. In this chapter, we review existing consensus protocols and\nscalability techniques in both well-established and next-generation blockchain\narchitectures. From this, we evaluate the most suitable solutions for managing\nMEC services and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of the available\nalternatives.\n\n</td>

This model originates in the field of blockchain\nand cryptoeconomics and is essentially a decentralized system where tokens\n(digital currency) are used to incentivize quality curation of information. TCR\nis an automated way to create lists of any kind where decisions (whether to\ninclude N or not) are made through voting that brings benefit or loss to\nvoters. In an academic journal, TCR could act as a tool to introduce\ncommunity-driven decisions on papers to be published, thus encouraging more\nactive participation of authors and reviewers in editorial policy and\nelaborating the idea of a journal as a club. TCR could also provide a novel\nsolution to the problems of editorial bias and the lack of rewards/incentives\nfor reviewers.

The survivability of a blockchain network is influenced by the\ndiversity of its nodes. Trustworthy device-level attestations permits nodes in\na blockchain network to provide truthful evidence regarding their current\nconfiguration, operational state, keying material and other system attributes.\nIn the current work we review the recent developments towards a standard\nattestation architecture and evidence conveyance protocols. We explore the\napplicability and benefits of a standard attestation architecture to blockchain\nnetworks.

      <td>On Blockchain Metatransactions</td>
      <td>\nAbstract:  In cryptocurrencies, transaction fees are typically exclusively paid in the\nnative platform currency. This restriction causes a wide range of challenges,\nsuch as deteriorated user experience, mandatory rent payments by decentralized\napplications, and blockchain community rivalries (e.g., coinism). Ideally, in a\ntruly permissionless blockchain, transaction fees should be payable in any\nother cryptocurrency via so-called metatransactions. In this paper, we\nformalize metatransactions, review existing ideas, and describe novel\nmetatransaction design approaches. Under the assumption of sufficient market\nliquidity, we argue that metatransactions do not lower the security of\ncryptocurrency platforms. However, without changing the underlying blockchain,\nmetatransaction designs typically increase transaction costs and reduce the\nblockchain transaction throughput.\n\n</td>

      <td>\nAbstract:  Blockchain and other forms of distributed ledger technology (DLT) provide an\nopportunity to integrate digital information, management, and contracts to\nincrease trust and collaboration within the construction industry. DLT enables\ndirect peer-to-peer transactions of value across a distributed network by\nproviding an immutable and transparent record of these transactions.\nFurthermore, there is potential for business process optimization and\nautomation on the transaction level, through the use of smart contracts, which\nare code protocols deployed on supported DLT systems. However, DLT research in\nthe construction industry remains at a theoretical level; there have been few\nimplementation case studies to date. One potential reason for this is a\nknowledge gap between use-case ideas and the DLT technical system\nimplementation. This paper aims to reduce this gap by 1) reviewing and\ncategorizing proposed DLT use cases in construction literature, 2) providing an\noverview of DLT and its design options, 3) proposing an integrated framework to\nmatch DLT design options with desired characteristics of a use case, and 4)\nanalysing the use cases using the new framework. Together, the use case\ncategories and proposed decision framework can guide future implementers toward\nmore connected and structured thinking between the technological properties of\nDLT and use cases in construction.\n\n</td>

We use the Convolution Lagrangian Perturbation Theory in addition\nto the Gaussian Streaming Redshift-Space Distortions to model the Legendre\nmultipoles of the anisotropic correlation function. We show that the eBOSS ELG\ncorrelation function measurement is affected by the contribution of a radial\nintegral constraint that needs to be modelled to avoid biased results. To\nmitigate the effect from unknown angular systematics, we adopt a modified\ncorrelation function estimator that cancels out the angular modes from the\nclustering.

We find that for the non-blind mocks, the models are able to recover\n$f\sigma_8$ to within 3% and $\alpha_\parallel$ and $\alpha_\bot$ to within 1%.\nThe scatter in the measurements is larger for the blind mocks, due to the\nassumption of an incorrect fiducial cosmology.

      <td>The Completed SDSS-IV Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey: Growth rate of structure measurement from cosmic voids</td>
      <td>\nAbstract:  We present a void clustering analysis in configuration-space using the\ncompleted Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV) extended Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) DR16 samples. These samples consist of Luminous\nRed Galaxies (LRG) combined with the high redshift tail of the SDSS-III Baryon\nOscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) DR12 CMASS galaxies (called as\nLRG+CMASS sample), Emission Line Galaxies (ELG) and quasars (QSO). We build\nvoid catalogues from the three eBOSS DR16 samples using a ZOBOV-based\nalgorithm, providing 2,814 voids, 1,801 voids and 4,347 voids in the LRG+CMASS,\nELG and QSO samples, respectively, spanning the redshift range $0.6&lt;z&lt;2.2$. We\nmeasure the redshift space distortions (RSD) around voids using the anisotropic\nvoid-galaxy cross-correlation function and we extract the distortion parameter\n$\beta$. We test the methodology on realistic simulations before applying it to\nthe data, and we investigate all our systematic errors on these mocks. We find\n$\beta^{\rm LRG}(z=0.74)=0.415\pm0.087$, $\beta^{\rm\nELG}(z=0.85)=0.665\pm0.125$ and $\beta^{\rm QSO}(z=1.48)=0.313\pm0.134$, for\nthe LRG+CMASS, ELG and QSO sample, respectively. The quoted errors include\nsystematic and statistical contributions. In order to convert our measurements\nin terms of the growth rate $f\sigma_8$, we use consensus values of linear bias\nfrom the eBOSS DR16 companion papers~\citep{eBOSScosmo}, resulting in the\nfollowing constraints: $f\sigma_8(z=0.74)=0.50\pm0.11$,\n$f\sigma_8(z=0.85)=0.52\pm0.10$ and $f\sigma_8(z=1.48)=0.30\pm0.13$. Our\nmeasurements are consistent with other measurements from eBOSS DR16 using\nconventional clustering techniques.\n\n</td>

Their median redshift is estimated to be\n$z_\mathrm{median}=$ 2.38 $\pm$ 0.14. They generally follow the tight\nrelationship of the stellar mass versus star formation rate (i.e., the main\nsequence of star-forming galaxies). ALMA-detected ZFOURGE sources exhibit\nsystematically larger infrared (IR) excess (IRX $\equiv\nL_\mathrm{IR}/L_\mathrm{UV}$) compared to ZFOURGE galaxies without ALMA\ndetections even though they have similar redshifts, stellar masses, and star\nformation rates. This implies the consensus stellar-mass versus IRX relation,\nwhich is known to be tight among rest-frame-UV-selected galaxies, can not fully\npredict the ALMA detectability of stellar-mass-selected galaxies. We find that\nALMA-detected ZFOURGE sources are the main contributors to the cosmic IR star\nformation rate density at $z$ = 2 - 3.\n\n</td>

In their comments about a novel, readers generally\ninclude only a subset of characters and their relationships, thus offering a\nlimited perspective on that work. Yet in aggregate, these reviews capture an\nunderlying narrative framework comprised of different actants (people, places,\nthings), their roles, and interactions that we label the "consensus narrative\nframework". We represent this framework in the form of an actant-relationship\nstory graph. Extracting this graph is a challenging computational problem,\nwhich we pose as a latent graphical model estimation problem. Posts and reviews\nare viewed as samples of sub graphs/networks of the hidden narrative framework.\nInspired by the qualitative narrative theory of Greimas, we formulate a\ngraphical generative Machine Learning (ML) model where nodes represent actants,\nand multi-edges and self-loops among nodes capture context-specific\nrelationships. We develop a pipeline of interlocking automated methods to\nextract key actants and their relationships, and apply it to thousands of\nreviews and comments posted on this http URL. We manually derive the ground\ntruth narrative framework from SparkNotes, and then use word embedding tools to\ncompare relationships in ground truth networks with our extracted networks. We\nfind that our automated methodology generates highly accurate consensus\nnarrative frameworks: for our four target novels, with approximately 2900\nreviews per novel, we report average coverage/recall of important relationships\nof &gt; 80% and an average edge detection rate of &gt;89\%. These extracted narrative\nframeworks can generate insight into how people (or classes of people) read and\nhow they recount what they have read to others.\n\n</td>

      <td>AbstractThe success of blockchain as the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies has opened up possibilities for its use in other application domains as well. The main advantages of blockchain for its potential use in other areas are its inherent security mechanisms and immunity to data manipulation attacks. A blockchain relies on a consensus method for agreeing on any new data. Most of the consensus methods which are currently used for the blockchain of different cryptocurrencies require high computational power and thus are not suitable for resource-constrained systems.In this article, we survey the various blockchain-based consensus methods that are applicable to resource-constrained IoT devices and networks. In a typical IoT network, there exist several devices with limited computational and communication capabilities. Most often, these devices cannot perform intensive computations and are starved for bandwidth. Therefore, we discuss the possible measures that can be taken to reduce the computational power and convergence time for the underlying consensus methods. We also talk about some of the alternatives to the public blockchain, such as private blockchain and tangle, along with their potential adoption for IoT networks. Furthermore, we review the existing consensus methods that have been implemented and explore the possibility of utilizing them to realize a blockchain-based IoT network. Some of the open research challenges including AI-enabled blockchains are also put forward.</td>

Over recent years, many studies have been done to cope with this problem. In this paper, a comparative and analytical review on the state-of-the-art blockchain consensus algorithms is presented to enlighten the strengths and constraints of each algorithm. Based on their inherent specifications, each algorithm has a different domain of applicability that yields to propose several performance criteria for the evaluation of these algorithms. To overview and provide a basis of comparison for further work in the field, a set of incommensurable and conflicting performance evaluation criteria is identified and weighted by the pairwise comparison method. These criteria are classified into four categories including algorithms’ throughput, the profitability of mining, degree of decentralization and consensus algorithms vulnerabilities and security issues. Based on the proposed framework, the pros and cons of consensus algorithms are systematically analyzed and compared in order to provide a deep understanding of the existing research challenges and clarify the future study directions.</td>

The Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) as well as the Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL) methodology are the most frequently employed techniques for bubble detection and measurement. Based on much academic research, Bitcoin appears to have been in a bubble-phase since June 2015, while Ethereum, NEM, Stellar, Ripple, Litecoin and Dash have been denoted as possessing bubble-like characteristics since September 2015. However, this latter group possess little academic evidence supporting the presence of bubbles since early 2018.

However, blockchain confronts some privacy risks that hinder its practical applications. Though numerous surveys reviewed the privacy preservation in blockchain, they failed to reveal the latest advances, nor have they been able to conduct a unified standard comprehensive classification of the privacy protection of permissionless blockchain. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the specific characteristics of permissionless blockchain, summarize the potential privacy threats, and investigate the unique privacy requirements of blockchain.

Ideally, blockchains are designed to be architecturally and politically decentralized, similar to the Internet. In recent times, however, blockchain-based systems have faced stumbling blocks in the form of challenges related to scalability, privacy, security, etc. Several new methods have been proposed both by the research and professional communities to mitigate these challenges. One such recent advancement proposed is the use of sidechains. A sidechain is a secondary blockchain connected to the main blockchain with a two-way peg. Sidechains may have their own consensus protocols, which could be completely different from the mainchain's protocol. Theoretically, a sidechain can add new functionalities, improve privacy, and security of traditionally vanilla blockchains. To this date, however, little is known or discussed regarding factors related to design choices, feasibility, limitations and other issues in adopting the sidechain technology. Moreover, there is a lack of studies discussing how and where it can effectively be integrated into blockchains to remedy current issues in a clear context. Hence, this paper provides the first comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art sidechains and platforms, identifying current advancements and analyzing their impact from various viewpoints, highlighting their limitations and discussing possible remedies for the overall improvement of the blockchain domain.</td>

      <td>Overview of Blockchain Technology Concepts</td>
      <td>AbstractBlockchain technology (BCT) has perhaps gained widespread attention around the world for roughly a decade. Since the technology was coined, researcher’s focus shifted to explore the insights of the technology. Nakamoto first introduced the concept of digital currency or cryptocurrency. Decentralized systems are the backbone of these cryptocurrencies and the technology behind these currencies are blockchain. Blockchain is a distributed ledger and one of the most promising, disruptive and revolutionary technology of today. Initially, all communities in the world believed that Bitcoin is blockchain and many myths were around what the technology is and impact of that technology in business applications. Later, an influence of core technology behind the Bitcoin had transformed the perception of the researchers, industrialists, and academicians in various domains such as Banking, Healthcare, Government, and so on.In order to know BCT in depth, the basic understanding of BCT concepts and key terms are to be explored in this chapter. Blockchain consists of chain of consecutive blocks of transactions. Traditional client/server systems are following client/server architecture and controlled by multiple administrators. But, BCT is a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) network and distributed in nature. Each and every participant of the network can control the network. BCT network consists of many computers connected together and the block cannot be altered without consensus of the whole network. Block can be considered as a container for the data. Computers in the blockchain network are called nodes and each node has copy of the digital ledger.Blockchain is continuously growing chain of blocks which are interconnected and protected with the help of cryptographic functions also. Validating of new blocks is followed by a set of protocols and consensus from every participant of the network. The records are stored in linear chain. Pointers and linked list data structures are used in blockchain for the block representation. Blocks are arranged in sequence and lined with each other using linked list. Pointers are used to point the location of the next block. Block is a collection of data that stores the transaction details such as timestamp, link to the previous block which is generated by secure hash algorithm. Every block has contains two parts: block header and block body.Blockchain is characterized by consensus, distributed computation, immutability, and authentication. Since blockchain is a budding technology, different types of applications require different types of blockchains. Permissionless or public blockchain does not have any control. Anyone can read or write into the network. At the same time, permissioned ledgers are restricted to authenticated users of the network. All blocks are encrypted by a private key and cannot be interpreted by anyone. Consortium blockchains are the combination of both the public and private blockchains.With the perspective of software architecture, understanding the working model of blockchain helps in implementation of technology in different domains. In the working model of blockchain, one party initiates the transaction by creating a block. Computers in the network validate the block and finally block is added to the chain and stored across the network. Even though BCT gained momentum in the future Internet systems, number of challenges are to be addressed carefully. Expertise in BCT technology is much needed since we are in nasal stage of this technology. An adoption of BCT offers promising features in various domains, but huge initial cost for the infrastructure is a major concern for the industries. Privacy and security factors also play an important role for the implementation of BCT. Scalability and legal regulations are also posing a major challenge for the adoption of BCT.</td>

      <td>Global drivers of cryptocurrency infrastructure adoption</td>
      <td>A vast digital ecosystem of entrepreneurship and exchange has sprung up with Bitcoin’s digital infrastructure at its core. We explore the worldwide spread of infrastructure necessary to maintain and grow Bitcoin as a system (Bitcoin nodes) and infrastructure enabling the use of bitcoins for everyday economic transactions (Bitcoin merchants). Specifically, we investigate the role of legal, criminal, financial, and social determinants of the adoption of Bitcoin infrastructure. We offer some support for the view that the adoption of cryptocurrency infrastructure is driven by perceived failings of traditional financial systems, in that the spread of Bitcoin infrastructure is associated with low trust in banks and the financial system among inhabitants of a region, and with the occurrence of country-level inflation crises. On the other hand, our findings also suggest that active support for Bitcoin is higher in locations with well-developed banking services. Finally, we find support for the view that bitcoin adoption is also partly driven by cryptocurrencies’ usefulness in engaging in illicit trade.</td>

      <td>Blockchains, Cryptocurrency, and Smart Contracts Technology: Security Considerations</td>
      <td>Blockchain was originally block chain, a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked data blocks and secured using cryptography. Today’s block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data, and it is represented as a Merkle tree. Transaction data consists of transactions. The data from each block hashes into a unique cryptographic number—a hash—as it links onto the next block. The unique number or hash makes each block on the blockchain immutable. This means a block of data on the blockchain can never be changed again. Thus, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data. The blockchain is stored in a distributed peer-to-peer network of servers, and any transaction, between any two or more parties, that uses the data in any of these blocks must be approved by a majority of all network servers using efficiently verifiable protocols. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the network majority. This last feature of decentralized consensus, possessed by the blockchain technology, gives it broad appeal in a variety of areas requiring recording of events such as medical records, all types of records management activities, such as identity management, transaction processing, documenting provenance, food traceability or voting . In this chapter, we discuss all these applications, security issues, and the future of blockchain technology.</td>

We examine the descriptive features, countries’ contributions and collaboration networks, author collaboration networks and reference co-citation networks to identify actors with significant influence in this field. The results show that cryptocurrency research is experiencing exponential growth, but scientific collaborations between different countries and authors are still insufficient. The intellectual bases of the cryptocurrency domain rest on the early-year literatures that provide fundamental understandings for cryptocurrency, and that bridge different research fields. The analysis indicates that the current research trend focuses on cryptocurrency market analysis incorporating market behaviors and trading characteristics.</td>

      <td>With the massive growth of cryptocurrency markets in recent years has come an influx of new users and investors, pushing the overall number of owners into the millions. At the same time, the number of distinct cryptocurrencies has exploded to over 4,900. In this burgeoning and chaotic “cryptojungle,” new and unexplored incentives and risks drive the behavior of users and non-users of cryptocurrencies. While previous research has focused almost exclusively on Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies and utility tokens have been ignored. This paper presents findings from an interview study of cryptocurrency users and non-users \((N=20)\). We specifically focus on their perceptions and management of cryptocurrency risks as well as their reasons for or against involvement with cryptocurrencies. Our results suggest that associated risks and mitigation strategies (among other factors) might be specific to a particular crypto-asset and its application area. Further, we identify misunderstandings of both users and non-users that might lead to skewed risk perceptions or dangerous errors. Lastly, we discuss ways of aiding users with managing risks, as well as design implications for coin management tools.</td>

With the exploitation of principles such as “Distraction”, “Authority”, and “Commitment, Reciprocation &amp; Consistency” the attackers gained access to users’ financial values, stored in cryptocurrencies, without undermining the security features of the blockchain itself. One reason for the attackers’ success is a lack of knowledge about risks and security among cryptocurrency users. Efforts to increase the information security awareness of cryptocurrency and blockchain users is recommended to protect them.</td>

The methods used for the analysis include various statistical methods as well as a trading simulation approach. The results suggest that hourly returns during the day of positive/negative abnormal returns are significantly higher/lower than those during the average positive/negative day. The presence of abnormal returns can usually be detected before the day ends by estimating specific timing parameters. Prices tend to move in the direction of the abnormal returns till the end of the day when it occurs, which implies the existence of a momentum effect on that day giving rise to exploitable profit opportunities. This effect (together with profit opportunities) is also observed on the following day. In two cases (BTCUSD positive abnormal returns and ETHUSD negative abnormal returns), a contrarian effect is detected instead.</td>

One characteristic feature of our approach is that we aim at a holistic view that would integrate all available information: First, financial information, including market capitalization and historical daily prices. Second, features related to the underlying blockchain from blockchain explorers like network activity: blockchains handle the supply and demand of a cryptocurrency. Lastly, we integrate software development metrics based on GitHub activity by the supporting team. We set two goals: First, to classify a given cryptocurrency by its performance, where stability and price increase are the positive features. Second, to forecast daily price tendency through regression; this is of course a well-studied problem. A related third goal is to determine the most relevant features for such analysis. We compare various neural networks using most of the widely traded digital currencies (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin) in both classification and regression settings. Simple Feedforward neural networks are considered, as well as Recurrent neural networks (RNN) along with their improvements, namely Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units.

We consider developers’ comments and activity for two major blockchain projects, namely Ethereum and Bitcoin, extracted from Github. We measure sentiment and emotions (joy, love, anger, etc.) of the developers’ comments over time, and test the corresponding time series (i.e. the affect time series) for correlations and causality with the Bitcoin/Ethereum time series of prices. Our analysis shows the existence of a Granger-causality between the time series of developers’ emotions and Bitcoin/Ethereum price. Moreover, using an artificial recurrent neural network (LSTM), we can show that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)—associated with the prediction of the prices of cryptocurrencies—significantly decreases when including the affect time series.</td>

      <td>Smart contracts are seen as the major building blocks for future autonomous blockchain- and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)-based applications. Engineering such contracts for trustless, append-only, and decentralized digital ledgers allows mutually distrustful parties to transform legal requirements into immutable and formalized rules. Previous experience shows this to be a challenging task due to demanding socio-technical ecosystems and the specificities of decentralized ledger technology. In this paper, we therefore develop an integrated process model for engineering DLT-based smart contracts that accounts for the specificities of DLT. This model was iteratively refined with the support of industry experts. The model explicitly accounts for the immutability of the trustless, append-only, and decentralized DLT ecosystem, and thereby overcomes certain limitations of traditional software engineering process models. More specifically, it consists of five successive and closely intertwined phases: conceptualization, implementation, approval, execution, and finalization. For each phase, the respective activities, roles, and artifacts are identified and discussed in detail. Applying such a model when engineering smart contracts will help software engineers and developers to better understand and streamline the engineering process of DLTs in general and blockchain in particular. Furthermore, this model serves as a generic framework which will support application development in all fields in which DLT can be applied.</td>

      <td>This paper presents a new direction in privacy preserving techniques for social networks based on consensus-driven blockchain and mechanism design principles. Privacy problem is among the class of the most important and fundamental problems in social networks. The most commonly accepted privacy solution is to incorporate a perfect data privacy policy and central system, which inherently lacks transparency and trust. All existing privacy techniques deny undesired users access to the information directly, but, in reality, the information may be forwarded to them from other users who possess the information. Our user-controlled privacy mechanism aims to control such data dissemination using simple game theoretic concepts combined with blockchain technology. Our mechanism applies to DAG structured networks (directed acyclic graphs), and our reward policy incentivizes the receivers if they do not diffuse the message in the network. We establish blockchain powered smart contracts to enable the flow of incentives in the system, without the involvement of a trusted third party. The owner of the message has to pay for the rewards, but our mechanism makes sure that the payment is minimum. In fact, the owner will have more utility when he/she pays. Our mechanism satisfies the necessary constraints of mechanism design, namely individual rationality, incentive compatibility, and weakly budget balance while ensuring privacy.</td>

In this paper, we focus on three vulnerabilities of smart contract: has_short_address, has_flows and is_greedy. For the three kinds of vulnerabilities, we propose slicing matrix, a new method to extract vulnerability feature, and construct three vulnerability detection models for comparison. The experimental results show that the detection accuracy based on neural network and slice matrix is better than that based on neural network and opcode features. In other words, slice matrix can improve the accuracy of vulnerable contract detection. Among our three detection models, the model based on random forest and opcode features performs best.</td>

Our analysis revealed that over 96% of the contracts had duplicates, while a large number of them were similar, which suggests that the ecosystem is highly homogeneous. Our results also suggested that roughly 9.7% of the similar contract pairs have exactly the same vulnerabilities, which we assume were introduced by code clones. In addition, we identified 41 DApps clusters, involving 73 plagiarized DApps which had caused huge financial loss to the original creators, accounting for 1/3 of the original market volume.</td>

      <td>The smart contract revolution: a solution for the holdup problem?</td>
      <td>This paper examines the concept of the holdup problem from an entrepreneurial angle in a world with smart contracts. All entrepreneurs need to use contracts. As theorists (Williamson 1979; Hart and Moore 1999; Hart 2009) point out, information asymmetry and opportunism are part of any contractual transaction between agents. This means that entrepreneurs have to deal with incomplete contracts. Blockchain was born in 1994 (Satoshi Nakamoto), alongside the emergence of smart contracts (Nick Szabo). The supporters of these IT protocols believe that they provide a solution to the holdup problem (Williamson 1985). In this article, we return to the models developed by Hart and Moore (1999) and Hart (2009) and discuss whether smart contracts correspond to the requirements discussed in the literature. We show that entrepreneurs need to carefully consider the use of smart contracts in function of the type of transaction they aim to put in place.</td>

This knowledge is powerful in the hands of those who have it, and can be used in multiple ways, not always to our benefit. Cryptocurrencies, such as the famous Bitcoin, were proposed as a means to address the limitations of centralized banking systems and to offer its users privacy with regards to their transactional data. In this work, we perform a systematic literature review on the realm of privacy for electronic currencies. We present the development of digital money from electronic cash to cryptocurrencies and focus on the techniques that are employed to enhance user-privacy. Furthermore, we present flaws of the current cryptocurrency systems, which reduce the privacy of the cryptocurrency users. Finally, we describe three research directions to enhance privacy for cryptocurrencies: transaction propagation mechanisms, succinct ZK proof systems without a trusted setup, and specialised trustless zero-knowledge proofs.</td>

The continuous improvement of consensus mechanisms such as PoW (proof-of-work), PoS (proof-of-stake), DPoS (delegated-proof-of-stake), and PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) has led to the evolution of Blockchain technology to Blockchain 3.0. Starting from the issue of Byzantine generals, this article analyzes common consensus mechanisms based on existing Blockchain applications and then evaluates their consistency.

AbstractBlockchain is the latest ‘disruptive innovation’ that has caught scholars’ attention. It is the underlying technology for Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Stakeholders like developers, entrepreneurs, and technology enthusiasts claim blockchain has the potential to reconfigure the contemporary economic, legal, political and cultural landscape. Skeptics claim the concept and its applications remain ambiguous and uncertain. Business scholars began publishing studies on the emergence and impact of blockchain, bitcoin, and related projects in 2014. In this study, we conduct a PRISMA guided systematic review of blockchain research in the business literature from 2014 to 2018. Our results show a rapid increase of studies over the five year period. The findings also convey key insights about the current state of scholarly investigation on blockchain, including its top benefits and challenges for business and society. We found that blockchain remains an early-stage domain of research in terms of theoretical grounding, methodological diversity, and empirically grounded work. We suggest research directions to improve our understanding of the state of blockchain and advance future research of this increasingly important and expansive area.</td>

While the first generation of blockchain technology (i.e., Blockchain 1.0) is almost exclusively used for cryptocurrency, the second generation (i.e., Blockchain 2.0), as represented by Ethereum, is an open and decentralized platform enabling a new paradigm of computing—Decentralized Applications (DApps) running on top of blockchains. The rich applications and semantics of DApps inevitably introduce many security vulnerabilities, which have no counterparts in pure cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin. Since Ethereum is a new, yet complex, system, it is imperative to have a systematic and comprehensive understanding on its security from a holistic perspective, which was previously unavailable in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, the present survey, which can also be used as a tutorial, fills this void. We systematize three aspects of Ethereum systems security: vulnerabilities, attacks, and defenses. We draw insights into vulnerability root causes, attack consequences, and defense capabilities, which shed light on future research directions.</td>

Instead of committing every transaction to the blockchain, a separate overlay network (called a PCN) is maintained.

      <td>As one of the key technologies of distributed ledgers, blockchain solves the trust problem in open network without relying on any trusted third party. Its decentralized feature has a broad application prospect, but still faces scalability problem. Currently, blockchain scalability bottleneck is mainly in three aspects: performance inefficiency, high confirmation delay, and function extension. For example, Bitcoin can only deal with 7 transactions per second averagely. Obviously, it cannot meet the requirement of current digital payment scenarios, nor can it be carried in other applications such as distributed storage and credit service. What's more, different blockchain systems carry different business and requirements, so scalability is the core issue of the current development of blockchain. This paper introduces the blockchain scalability related technologies from the aspects of improving efficiency and extending functionality of blockchain system, respectively. We summarize four mainstream solutions to improve the performance of blockchain system, including Sharding mechanism, directed acyclic graph based (DAG-based), off-chain payment network and cross-chain technology.

Most of the devices involved in blockchain-related processes are specially designed targeting only the mining aspect, i.e., solving the computational puzzle task. At the same time, the use of wearable and mobile devices may also become a part of eCommerce blockchain operation, especially during the on-charge time. The paper considers the possibility of using a large number of constrained devices to support the operation of the blockchain with a low impact on battery consumption. The utilization of such devices is expected to improve the system efficiency as well as to attract a more substantial number of users. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge with a survey of the main applications of blockchain for smartphones along with existing mobile blockchain projects.

The system was deployed in a worldwide testnet with more than two thousand smartphones and compared with other projects from the user-experienced metrics perspective. The results prove that the utilization of PoA systems on a smartphone does not significantly affect the lifetime of the smartphone battery while existing methods based on PoW have a tremendous negative impact.

      <td>Today, the online review system cannot fully support the business since there are fraudulent activities inside. The companies that get low score reviews are induced to raise their score for the market competition capability by paying to the platform for deleting or editing the posted reviews. Moreover, the automatic filtration system of a platform removes some reviews without the awareness of the users. The low transparency platform causes low credibility toward the reviews. Blockchain technology provides exceptionally high transparency since every action can be traced publicly. However, there are some tradeoffs that need to be considered, such as cost and response time. This work tends to find the potential of using Blockchain technology in the online review system by testing four implementation approaches of the Ethereum Smart Contract. The result illustrates that using IPFS to store the data is a practical way of reducing transaction costs. Besides, preventing using Smart Contract states can significantly reduce costs too. The response time for using the Blockchain and IPFS system is slower than the centralized system. However, posting a review does not need a fast response. Thus, it is worthy of trading response time with transparency and cost. In the business view, the review posting with cost causes more difficulty to generate fake reviews. Moreover, there are other advantages over the centralized system, such as the reward system, bogus review voting, and global database. Thus, credibility improvement for a consumer online review system is a potential application of Blockchain technology.</td>

Although many security solutions and standards have been proposed over the years to enhance the security levels of aforementioned smart applications, but the existing solutions are either based upon the centralized architecture (having single point of failure) or having high computation and communication costs. Moreover, most of the existing security solutions have focussed only on few aspects and fail to address scalability, robustness, data storage, network latency, auditability, immutability, and traceability.

      <td>A Systematic Review of Blockchain in Healthcare: Frameworks, Prototypes, and Implementations</td>
      <td>Blockchain, a form of distributed ledger technology has attracted the interests of stakeholders across several sectors including healthcare. Its' potential in the multi-stakeholder operated sector like health has been responsible for several investments, studies, and implementations. Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems traditionally used for the exchange of health information amongst healthcare stakeholders have been criticised for centralising power, failures and attack-points with exchange data custodians. EHRs have struggled in the face of multi-stakeholder and system requirements while adhering to security, privacy, ethical and other regulatory constraints. Blockchain is promising amongst others to address the many EHR challenges, primarily trustless and secure exchange of health information amongst stakeholders. Many blockchain-in-healthcare frameworks have been proposed; some prototyped and/or implemented. This study leveraged the PRISMA framework to systematically search and evaluate the different models proposed; prototyped and/or implemented. The bibliometric and functional distribution of all 143 articles from this study were presented. This study evaluated 61 articles that discussed either prototypes or pilot or implementations. The technical and architectural analysis of these 61 articles for privacy, security, cost, and performance were detailed. Blockchain was found to solve the trust, security and privacy constraints of traditional EHRs often at significant performance, storage and cost trade-offs.</td>

This paper outlines the existing solutions to blockchain scalability, which can be classified into two categories: \n&lt;italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;first layer&lt;/italic&gt;\n and \n&lt;italic xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;second layer solutions&lt;/italic&gt;\n. First layer solutions propose modifications to the blockchain (i.e., changing the blockchain structure, such as block size) while second layer solutions propose mechanisms that are implemented outside of the blockchain. In particular, we focus on sharding as a promising first layer solution to the scalability issue; the basic idea behind sharding is to divide the blockchain network into multiple committees, each processing a separate set of transactions. More specifically, (a) we propose a taxonomy based on committee formation and intra-committee consensus; and (b) we compare the main existing sharding-based blockchain protocols. We also present a performance-based comparative analysis (i.e., throughput and latency), of the advantages, and disadvantages in existing scalability solutions.</td>

However, 5G marks a radical shift from this focus as 5G and beyond networks are being designed to be future-proof by catering to diverse requirements of several use cases. These requirements include Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications, Massive Machine-Type Communications and Enhanced Mobile Broadband. To realize such features in 5G and beyond, there is a need to rethink how current cellular networks are deployed because designing new radio access technologies and utilizing the new spectrum are not enough. Several technologies, such as software-defined networking, network function virtualization, machine learning and cloud computing, are being integrated into the 5G networks to fulfil the need for diverse requirements. These technologies, however, give rise to several challenges associated with decentralization, transparency, interoperability, privacy and security. To address these issues, Blockchain has emerged as a potential solution due to its capabilities such as transparency, data encryption, auditability, immutability and distributed architecture.

They are also decentralized, immutable, and append-only ledger; those ledgers can store any type of data and are shared among all the participants of the network. These platforms provide a high degree of anonymity for their users' identity and full transparency of the activities recorded on the ledger while simultaneously ensuring data security and tamper-resistance. All nodes on the network collectively work to validate the same set of data and to achieve group consensus. Blockchain platforms like Ethereum have the ability to develop smart contracts and embed business logic. This allows the use of blockchain beyond cryptocurrency as a business management solution. Besides the issues of scalability and the expensive nature of most blockchain systems, many attributes of traditional public blockchain are not desirable in a business or enterprise context such as anonymity, full transparency, and permissionless.

Basically Blockchain is a distributed immutable ledgerutilized by user mainly to perform transactions across various nodes in a blockchain network after a mutual consensus of all the associated nodes in the network. Noticeably, Blockchain is made famous by the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. As of 2017 Blockchain has seen to disrupt many applications to a global worth of 150B. The consensus models are responsible for the process of reaching an agreement between all nodes in blockchain to accept a new block. The consensus model plays a vital role in sustaining Blockchain efficiency. Using the right consensus model can significantly increase the performance of blockchain operation. The consensus models can be divided into two categories. The first category is the proof-based consensus model whereby a node in the Blockchain performs enough proof over other nodes to gain a chance to append the next block to the chain. The second category is the voting-based model in which nodes need to share their results in verifying a transaction of a new block before a final decision is reached. In this paper we discuss the characteristics of some major existing consensus models and provide some critical reviews on their performances. The reviewis mainly concerning these aspects: transaction throughput, latency, network bandwidth, and storage.</td>

Backward-reference list checking was conducted to identify other relevant references. Study selection process was performed in three steps based on PRISMA flow diagram. Extracted data were synthesised and presented narratively using tables and figures.ResultsThe search resulted in 84 relevant studies that have been conducted of which only 37 unique studies were included in this review. Eight benefits of blockchain were categorised in either patient related-benefits (security and authorisation, personalised healthcare, patients' health data tracking, and patient’s health status monitoring) or organisational-related benefits (health information exchange, pharmaceutical supply chain, clinical trials, and medical insurance management). Meanwhile, eight threats of blockchain were categorised into three groups: organisational threats (installation and transaction costs, interoperability issues, and lack of technical skills), social threats (social acceptance and regulations issues), and technological threats (scalability issues, authorisation and security issues, high energy consumption, and slow processing speeds).ConclusionBlockchain is a viable technology that can improve the healthcare data sharing and storing system owing to its decentralisation, immutability, transparency and traceability features. However, many healthcare organisations remain hesitant to adopt blockchain technology due to threats such as security and authorisation issues, interoperability issues and lack of technical skills related to blockchain technology.</td>

Traditional Internet of Things (IoT) traceability systems provide the feasible solutions for the quality monitoring and traceability of food supply chains. However, most of the IoT solutions rely on the centralized server-client paradigm that makes it difficult for consumers to acquire all transaction information and to track the origins of products. Blockchain is a cutting-edge technology that has great potential for improving traceability performance by providing security and full transparency. However, the benefits, challenges and development methods of blockchain-based food traceability systems are not yet fully explored in the current literature. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to review the blockchain technology characteristics and functionalities, identify blockchain-based solutions for addressing food traceability concerns, highlight the benefits and challenges of blockchain-based traceability systems implementation, and help researchers and practitioners to apply blockchain technology based food traceability systems by proposing an architecture design framework and suitability application analysis flowchart of blockchain based food traceability systems. The results of this study contribute to better understanding and knowledge on how to improve the food traceability by developing and implementing blockchain-based traceability systems. The paper provides valuable information for researchers and practitioners on the use of blockchain-based food traceability management and has a positive effect on the improvement of food sustainability.</td>

IoE uses Internet to collect, organize, optimize and manage the networks energy information from different edge devices in order to develop a distributed smart energy infrastructure. Sensors and communication technologies are used to collect data and to predict demand and supply by consumers and suppliers respectively. However, with the development of renewable energy resources, Electric Vehicles (EVs), smart grid and Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, the existing energy sector started shifting towards distributed and decentralized solutions. Moreover, the security and privacy issues because of centralization is another major concern for IoE technology. In this context, Blockchain technology with the features of automation, immutability, public ledger facility, irreversibility, decentralization, consensus and security has been adopted in the literature for solving the prevailing problems of centralized IoE architecture. By leveraging smart contracts, blockchain technology enables automated data exchange, complex energy transactions, demand response management and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading etc. Blockchain will play vital role in the evolution of the IoE market as distributed renewable resources and smart grid network are being deployed and used. We discuss the potential and applications of blockchain in the IoE field.

The regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US had earlier limited the usage of UAVs to military applications. However more recently, the FAA has outlined new enforcement that will also expand the usage of UAVs in civilian and commercial applications. Due to being deployed in open atmosphere, UAVs are vulnerable to being lost, destroyed or physically hijacked. With the UAV technology becoming ubiquitous, various issues in UAV networks such as intra-UAV communication, UAV security, air data security, data storage and management, etc. need to be addressed. Blockchain being a distributed ledger protects the shared data using cryptography techniques such as hash functions and public key encryption. It can also be used for assuring the truthfulness of the information stored and for improving the security and transparency of the UAVs. In this paper, we review various applications of blockchain in UAV networks such as network security, decentralized storage, inventory management, surveillance, etc., and discuss some broader perspectives in this regard.

IoT is prone to several cyberattacks and needs challenging approaches to achieve the desired security. Moreover, with the emergence of IIoT, the security vulnerabilities posed by it are even more devastating. Therefore, in order to provide a guideline to researchers, this survey primarily attempts to classify the attacks based on the objects of vulnerability. Subsequently, each of the individual attacks is mapped to one or more layers of the generalized IoT/IIoT architecture followed by a discussion on the countermeasures proposed in literature. Some relevant real-life attacks for each of these categories are also discussed. We further discuss the countermeasures proposed for the most relevant security threats in IIoT. A case study on two of the most important industrial IoT applications is also highlighted. Next, we explore the challenges brought by the centralized IoT/IIoT architecture and how blockchain can effectively be used towards addressing such challenges. In this context, we also discuss in detail one IoT specific Blockchain design known as Tangle, its merits and demerits. We further highlight the most relevant Blockchain-based solutions provided in recent times to counter the challenges posed by the traditional cloud-centered applications. The blockchain-related solutions provided in the context of two of the most relevant applications for each of IoT and IIoT is also discussed. Subsequently, we design a taxonomy of the security research areas in IoT/IIoT along with their corresponding solutions.

Traceability system (TS) is designed to assure safe and good quality food, while reducing the costs of food recalls. It should encompass all stakeholders, including governments, companies, and consumers, each of whom has an important role in the implementation and guardianship of such systems. The EU and China are amongst the main players implementing TS and are constantly exploring new opportunities and monitoring challenges for TS in a time of shifting consumer demands and rapid new technology innovation.Scope and approachThis article states development stages from TS 1.0 to 3.0. and reviews TS development in a number of key countries and regions. Comparisons between the EU and China are drawn in terms of government, corporate, and consumer involvement in traceability.Key findings and conclusionsA functional TS, while providing bi-directional communication between trading partners, must meet the laws and regulations where it operates. A functional system must also consider consumer value and perception, which varies with geography. There are a variety of promising technologies available on the market today to modernize TS, including artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain. A key finding of this research is that both the EU and China have developed significant trade links in recent years which will certainly positively impact both economies. Key to underpinning the sustainability of these trade links will be the adoption of common TS to prevent negative associations.</td>

Communication between humans and objects has been extended into those between objects and objects. Industrial IoT (IIoT) takes benefits of IoT communications in business applications focusing in interoperability between machines (i.e., IIoT is a subset from the IoT). Number of daily life things and objects connected to the Internet has been in increasing fashion, which makes the IoT be the dynamic network of networks. Challenges such as heterogeneity, dynamicity, velocity, and volume of data, make IoT services produce inconsistent, inaccurate, incomplete, and incorrect results, which are critical for many applications especially in IIoT (e.g., health-care, smart transportation, wearable, finance, industry, etc.). Discovering, searching, and sharing data and resources reveal 40% of IoT benefits to cover almost industrial applications. Enabling real-time data analysis, knowledge extraction, and search techniques based on Information Communication Technologies (ICT), such as data fusion, machine learning, big data, cloud computing, blockchain, etc., can reduce and control IoT and leverage its value. This research presents a comprehensive review to study state-of-the-art challenges and recommended technologies for enabling data analysis and search in the future IoT presenting a framework for ICT integration in IoT layers. This paper surveys current IoT search engines (IoTSEs) and presents two case studies to reflect promising enhancements on intelligence and smartness of IoT applications due to ICT integration.</td>

      <td>Achieving sustainable performance in a data-driven agriculture supply chain: A review for research and applications</td>
      <td>AbstractThe lack of industrialization, inadequacy of the management, information inaccuracy, and inefficient supply chains are the significant issues in an agri-food supply chain. The proposed solutions to overcome these challenges should not only consider the way the food is produced but also take care of societal, environmental and economic concerns. There has been increasing use of emerging technologies in the agriculture supply chains. The internet of things, the blockchain, and big data technologies are potential enablers of sustainable agriculture supply chains. These technologies are driving the agricultural supply chain towards a digital supply chain environment that is data-driven. Realizing the significance of a data-driven sustainable agriculture supply chain we extracted and reviewed 84 academic journals from 2000 to 2017. The primary purpose of the review was to understand the level of analytics used (descriptive, predictive and prescriptive), sustainable agriculture supply chain objectives attained (social, environmental and economic), the supply chain processes from where the data is collected, and the supply chain resources deployed for the same. Based on the results of the review, we propose an application framework for the practitioners involved in the agri-food supply chain that identifies the supply chain visibility and supply chain resources as the main driving force for developing data analytics capability and achieving the sustainable performance. The framework will guide the practitioners to plan their investments to build a robust data-driven agri-food supply chain. Finally, we outline the future research directions and limitations of our study.</td>

Since the origins of the industrial revolution, where the steam engines started the concept of Industry 1.0 and later the use of electricity upgraded the concept to Industry 2.0, the use of technologies generated a milestone in the industry revolution by addressing the Industry 3.0 concept. Hence, Industry 4.0, it is about including and integrating the latest developments based on digital technologies as well as the interoperability process across them. This allows enterprises to transmit real-time information in terms behaviour and performance. Therefore, the challenge is to maintain these complex networked structures efficiently linked and organised within the use of such technologies, especially to identify and satisfy supply chain stakeholders dynamic requirements. In this context, the agriculture domain is not an exception although it possesses some specialities depending from the domain. In fact, all agricultural machinery incorporates electronic controls and has entered to the digital age, enhancing their current performance. In addition, electronics, using sensors and drones, support the data collection of several agriculture key aspects, such as weather, geographical spatialization, animals and crops behaviours, as well as the entire farm life cycle. However, the use of the right methods and methodologies for enhancing agriculture supply chains performance is still a challenge, thus the concept of Industry 4.0 has evolved and adapted to agriculture 4.0 in order analyse the behaviours and performance in this specific domain. Thus, the question mark on how agriculture 4.0 support a better supply chain decision-making process, or how can help to save time to farmer to make effective decision based on objective data, remains open. Therefore, in this survey, a review of more than hundred papers on new technologies and the new available supply chains methods are analysed and contrasted to understand the future paths of the Agri-Food domain.</td>

      <td>Omni-channel management in the new retailing era: A systematic review and future research agenda</td>
      <td>AbstractOmni-channel retailing is a popular strategy in a new retailing era when digitalization, social media, big data and other emerging technologies (e.g., Artificial Intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), blockchain, etc.) are transforming the retail business models. Meanwhile, omni-channel related operations impose a challenge on either well-established firms or new setups that they have to make “right” decisions to fit in the new retail environment. This review paper endeavors to reveal the established knowledge behind the omni-channel retailing literature, generate managerial implications for firms, and provides a guideline for future research. We conduct this systematic review by adopting citation network analysis (CNA). The CNA helps identify seven independent and interdependent research domains, which depict (or constitute) a whole picture of “omnichannel management”. The main path analysis reveals that each identified research domain is under study. We also find that the extant literature seldom examines the roles of how new technologies play in the “omnichannel management”. Moreover, the domain of supply chain management and inventory management in the omnichannel environment is absent in this systematic literature review. Therefore, we propose a prescribed framework for “omnichannel management” (PFOM), which contributes to the literature on “omnichannel management” and provides important managerial applications to the retail firms that plan to implement the omnichannel strategy.</td>

      <td>AbstractThese days the advances in communication technologies, IoT, and intelligent smart meters lead the conventional unilateral power grids into intelligent bilateral ones. In newly emerging smart electric grids, distributed renewable resources and demand can play a proactive role, changing the structure of the system from the centralized unilateral scheme to the smart bilateral networks. In a smart grid environment, the data from smart meters have the capability to be transmitted in less than a second, leading to better management of the consumption. Nevertheless, the newly intelligent grids give birth to some challenges. What would be the best platform in which different parties can easily trade energy with each other? How can the grid be immunized against cyberattack and personal information leakage? Promoting trust between participants is another issue coming with the advent of the smart grids. Management of small participants, such as small customers or prosumers, should be managed through a third-party entity like an aggregator. However, the aggregator itself can incur costs for small customers. Blockchain technology could be an efficient solution to address the aforementioned smart grids’ problems.</td>

Distributed battery storage, such as electric vehicles batteries and stationary ones, ranging from around a dozen to a few hundred kWh and photovoltaic (PV) systems are disruptive technologies not only because they can individually contribute to CO2 emissions reduction but also due to the positive synergies between them. Batteries can store electricity surplus produced by PVs during the day, avoiding curtailment, and restore it to the grid to shave peak load or when external grid constraints are identified.We provide an analytical framework identifying the main research areas dealing with PV—EV–battery relationships to academics, stakeholders and policymakers willing to acquire further knowledge on this topic. The coupling between PV—EV–battery depends not only on the technological progress or economic regulations, but also on the under-explored user acceptance towards the technologies. First, emerging technologies (e.g. microgrids, vehicle-to-grid and blockchain) will deeply impact PV–EV–battery synergy, forcing electricity grid operators to readjust the way how the grid is managed. Second, inappropriate economic regulations (e.g obsolete tariff and ancillary services market designs) and outdated strategies formulated by the automotive sector could jeopardize all the potential benefits brought by the coupling. Then, user acceptance is found to be a decisive variable in whether people are willing to invest in distributed energy systems. Finally, we identify the literature gaps that warrant further investigation.</td>

Major challenges such as overpopulation, competition for resources poses a threat to the food security of the planet. In order to tackle the ever-increasing complex problems in agricultural production systems, advancements in smart farming and precision agriculture offers important tools to address agricultural sustainability challenges. Data analytics hold the key to ensure future food security, food safety, and ecological sustainability. Disruptive information and communication technologies such as machine learning, big data analytics, cloud computing, and blockchain can address several problems such as productivity and yield improvement, water conservation, ensuring soil and plant health, and enhance environmental stewardship. The current study presents a systematic review of machine learning (ML) applications in agricultural supply chains (ASCs). Ninety three research papers were reviewed based on the applications of different ML algorithms in different phases of the ASCs. The study highlights how ASCs can benefit from ML techniques and lead to ASC sustainability. Based on the study findings an ML applications framework for sustainable ASC is proposed. The framework identifies the role of ML algorithms in providing real-time analytic insights for pro-active data-driven decision-making in the ASCs and provides the researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with guidelines on the successful management of ASCs for improved agricultural productivity and sustainability.</td>

Thus, the goal of this paper is to outline how the current lack of a shared understanding of the term “trust” leads to diverging interpretations of the blockchain technology’s core features. Furthermore, it shows how this lack of common understanding obstructs scholars from referring to one another meaningfully in the discourse on blockchain technology.

The major issues in IV data sharing are trust, data accuracy, and reliability of data sharing in the communication channel. Blockchain technology, previously working for the cryptocurrency, has been recently applied to build trust and reliability in peer-to-peer networks with similar topologies of IV data sharing. In this chapter, we present a new framework, namely biometric blockchain (BBC), for secure IV data sharing. In our new scheme, biometric information is exploited as a cue to record who is responsible in the data sharing activities, while the proposed BBC technology serves as the backbone of the IV data sharing architecture.

      <td>Leveraging blockchain for immutable logging and querying across multiple sites</td>
      <td>BackgroundBlockchain has emerged as a decentralized and distributed framework that enables tamper-resilience and, thus, practical immutability for stored data. This immutability property is important in scenarios where auditability is desired, such as in maintaining access logs for sensitive healthcare and biomedical data. However, the underlying data structure of blockchain, by default, does not provide capabilities to efficiently query the stored data. In this investigation, we show that it is possible to efficiently run complex audit queries over the access log data stored on blockchains by using additional key-value stores. This paper specifically reports on the approach we designed for the blockchain track of iDASH Privacy &amp; Security Workshop 2018 competition. In this track, participants were asked to devise an efficient way to run conjunctive equality and range queries on a genomic dataset access log trail after storing it in a permissioned blockchain network consisting of 4 identical nodes, each representing a different site, created with the Multichain platform.MethodsMultichain duplicates and indexes blockchain data locally at each node in a key-value store to support retrieval requests at a later point in time. To efficiently leverage the key-value storage mechanism, we applied various techniques and optimizations, such as bucketization, simple data duplication and batch loading by accounting for the required query types of the competition and the interface provided by Multichain. Particularly, we implemented our solution and compared its loading and query-response performance with SQLite, a commonly used relational database, using the data provided by the iDASH 2018 organizers.ResultsDepending on the query type and the data size, the run time difference between blockchain based query-response and SQLite based query-response ranged from 0.2 seconds to 6 seconds. A deeper inspection revealed that range queries were the bottleneck of our solution which, nevertheless, scales up linearly.ConclusionsThis investigation demonstrates that blockchain-based systems can provide reasonable query-response times to complex queries even if they only use simple key-value stores to manage their data. Consequently, we show that blockchains may be useful for maintaining data with auditability and immutability requirements across multiple sites.</td>

      <td>Indian Judicial System is the strongest institution of the world’s largest democracy. Its purpose is to give justice to innocent and punish the guilty. Yet pendency of thousands of cases is the matter of serious concern. Shortage of judges and infrastructure has been highlighted as one of the major reasons for the same. Undeniably corruption and counsel-side delays are other prominent reasons for prolonged delay. To mitigate such delays, there is a need for more accountable and transparent judicial system. This paper aims to overcome the current loopholes in Indian Judicial System with an application of blockchain system. The paper discusses sample issues faced by common man in court along with the alternatives available and provides blockchain solution as the substitute. This approach implicitly limits the advocates, agents, and court officials to exploit judicial system for the benefit of individual and culprits. The proposed system will help regain the trust of common man in the Indian Judicial System.</td>

      <td>Intelligent systems are becoming increasingly complex and pervade a broad range of application domains, including safety-critical systems such as e-health, finance, and energy management. Traditional approaches are no longer capable of addressing the demand for trust and transparency in these applications. Hence, the current decade is demanding intelligent systems to be autonomous, and in particular explainable, transparent, and trustworthy. To satisfy such requirements, and therefore to comply with the recent EU regulations in the matter (e.g., GDPR), intelligent systems (e.g., Multi-Agent Systems - MAS) and technologies enabling tamper-proof and distributed consensus (e.g., Blockchain Technology - BCT) are conveying into reconciling solutions. Recently, the empowerment of MAS with BCT (and the use of BCT themselves) has gained considerable momentum, raising challenges, and unveiling opportunities. However, several ethical concerns have yet to be faced. This paper elaborates on the entanglement among ethical and technological challenges while proposing and discussing approaches that address these emerging research opportunities.</td>

Blockchain platforms are currently being used across the world in several government processes and business domains, for their unique characteristics. Even though blockchain shows potentials in its ability to provide a limitless number of inventive commercial trading, payments, government, healthcare, military and other critical applications, they face a security weakness on their recent prominent breaches of exchanges. Hence, there remain major security issues that are essential to be overcome before blockchain adopts the mainstream. And currently, this technology relies on hardware security modules (HSM) for the management and protection of their digital keys. The HSM generates key pairs, has secure storage and can off-load cryptographic operations from the entire system. But recently, FPGAs are preferred for hardware realization of algorithms considering its flexibility, low cost and long-term maintenance. It also has an advantage of reconfigurable or reprogrammable hardware design whenever new security or adaptation of an algorithm is required to support higher security levels. The paper presents a review of hardware security modules and proposed to enhance the scalability and reliability of the HSM by implementing it with the silicon-based secure module. Integrating PUF technology into the chip for storing and securing encryption or private keys, its security level can also be improved.</td>

With the emergence of blockchain technology, more and more companies in different industries have considered using it to support supply chain finance. In this paper, we study supply chain financing problems in supply chains selling fashionable products. Modeling under the standard newsvendor problem setting with a single manufacturer and a single retailer employing a revenue sharing contract, we develop analytical models for both the traditional and blockchain-supported supply chains. We derive the optimal contracting and quantity decisions in each supply chain with Nash bargaining between the manufacturer and retailer. We analytically show how the revenue sharing contract can coordinate both types of supply chains. We then compare the optimal systems performances between the two supply chains. We prove that the blockchain-supported supply chain incurs a lower level of operational risk than the traditional supply chain. We have shown that if the service fees by banks are sufficiently high, adopting blockchain technology is a mean-risk dominating policy which brings a higher expected profit and a lower risk for the supply chain and its members. For robustness checking, we examine other commonly seen supply chain contracts and alternative risk measures, and analytically reveal that the results remain valid.</td>

The huge rise in the growing demand of food and making it sustainable for people is encouraging the need for smart farming. There is a great potential to transform traditional farming profoundly by integrating Internet of things (IoT), Blockchain, and Geospatial technologies to emerge as Smart Farming. Blockchain based farming provides farmers various instant agricultural data at one secured platform, represents a unique opportunity to bring greater efficiency, sustainable crop production, tackle food scarcity, and adds transparency and traceability to the exchange of data related to farming management. Uses of Blockchain in farming management is not only improving the food traceability but also making farming safer for farmers as well as consumers involved, less uncertain and more profitable to the farmers. This paper describes the use of Blockchain technology in farming to manage the practices in a smarter as well as sustainable way, by presenting the decentralized infrastructure with added immutable geospatial technology and IoT sensors capabilities. Our proposed system architecture will explain how Blockchain technology with GIS &amp; IoT will revolutionize the traditional farming practices. Moreover, Blockchain preserves the stakeholders privacy by enhancing IoT framework with more reliable and secure data. Likewise, geospatial technologies create the greater impact by providing visualization and decision making through analytics by transforming traditional farming into sustainable farming.</td>

Also, the authentication process involves sharing the copy of already issued identity proof. Many a time, identity proofs are shared with individuals who cannot be trusted for their integrity. This can result in misuse of the identity documents for socially evil activities. Blockchain provides a decentralized trust-less network which nobody owns, but everyone can use. The proposed system provides solution to the identity management problem by putting personal identifiers on blockchain.

Healthcare organisations face a huge challenge in the diverse collation of data that are held in systems which are mostly in silo operation and little scope for interoperability or accessibility of medical data. Lack of data access or trust in its accuracy makes the task more challenging and problematic for healthcare institutions whose preference undoubtably would be to focus their energies on the decision making side of a patient’s health in assessing organ donor suitability and urgency to organ match due to the receiving patient criticalities, rather than time and resources spent on validating data authenticity, etc. There are further complications that can occur in potential mix-ups of organs, contamination of DNA during organ transplant, non-ethical organ supply and audit trail transparency related to these activities. There is a serious question on how to create a single source of the truth and blockchain may provide the best possibilities. Blockchain is becoming a more sought after technology being used in the healthcare space due to its attributes of immutability, traceability and security whilst providing that assurance of transparency and audit trail. Blockchain looks to be a good fit to manage the supply chain of organ procurement/placement and an audit control method to analyse data in any pre or post operation event. Combined with the right processes, in the form of a cyber security framework/maturity model for the healthcare industry, would ensure that all those who signed up to the blockchain deployed for the supply chain logistics would respect the ethics and requirements and expect transparency for those authorised to access. However, some challenges exist in GDPR compliancy of data that would exist on a certain proposed blockchain models and needs further exploring with regards to benefits in data held off-chain.</td>

The article touches upon the issues of civil law regulation of smart contracts in the light of the introduction of Federal law No. 34-FZ, adopted by the State Duma on March 12, 2019 that amends to the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, including the legal definition of “smart contract”. The benefits and disadvantages of the practical use of smart contracts and the existing problems of applying the norms of civil legislation to smart contracts are examined. The purpose of the study of these issues is to identify and consider the theoretical and practical problems of using the distributed data ledger blockchain technology in smart contracts. The decisive research method for achieving this result was a system analysis of the “smart contract” category. The methods also include general scientific dialectical method of cognition, private scientific methods (formal-legal, method of interpretation of legal norms, method of legal modeling) and empirical methods (comparison, description, interpretation). In the end, the author concludes that the definition of “smart contract” should be technologically neutral. There is strong advocacy for the view that distributed ledger data, including blockchain technology, should not be part of the definition of a smart contract, since in the future it might be possible to conclude “smart contracts” created on the basis of a more advanced technology than blockchain. The results of the study formulated by the author can serve as a basis for further research of transactions made by electronic or other technical means, and other problems of the theory of civil law.</td>

We propose to solve the optimisation problem with a distributed method using game theory, where each element of the grid tries to reach its own objectives. In addition to this optimisation framework, we develop a physical model of the grid. This model uses real consumption and production data. We use it to simulate the production and consumption profiles obtained from the optimisation problem in order to check if these solutions respect the grid constraints. Finally, we propose to implement concretely this distributed approach using a private blockchain, which stores production and consumption data. In addition, a smart contract is deployed on the blockchain to transcribe the game theory framework. The smart contract collects the preferences of each element of the grid and launches the optimisation process. Then the blockchain gathers the results and replaces the role of a central optimisation supervisor. We present some preliminary results to illustrate our method.</td>

      <td>Blockchain is the new disruptive technology which is gaining momentum in several domains of real-world applications such as Bitcoin—the most well-known example, and primarily in the financial sector. Distributed ledger system which is the main feature of blockchain technology protected across harmful updates using cryptographic techniques, e.g. hashing and digital signatures, is spread over the network so that no one is the owner of the ledger. This poses a significant challenge in the areas of performance, security, and privacy using this emerging technology. We propose an algorithm to provide a secure mechanism for performing transactions on the Blockchain network by adopting quantum digital signatures (QDS) and quantum teleportation phenomenon of quantum computing. The proposed algorithm uses key pairs to generate private keys and corresponding public keys; the quantum digital signatures are used to sign the message which are then distributed over the blockchain network using the teleportation phenomenon. The security of the keys is dependent on the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics that doesn’t allow forging. The Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) pair of particles is used to communicate the quantum information via a quantum channel for teleportation, which is generated by operating Bell measurements with corresponding EPR pairs. The original state of the particle (sender) is destroyed once the information is transported to the other particle (receiver) and the QDS scheme also validates the qubits received. The twofold validation process thereby provides high-level security in the transactions.\n</td>

The blockchain technology plays an important role in monitoring product quality and responding to product safety problems. Under considering the traceability awareness of consumers and the cost of using the blockchain technology, should the supply chain adopt the blockchain technology? The research on this issue deserves great attentions. In this paper, for a three-stage supply chain consisting of a supplier, a manufacturer and a retailer, we study the optimal pricing strategies of the supply chain considering the traceability awareness of consumers in two scenarios. These two scenarios are: scenario N (i.e., the supply chain does not adopt the blockchain technology) and scenario B (i.e., the supply chain adopts the blockchain technology). On this basis, we discuss the conditions that the supply chain adopts the blockchain technology by comparing the optimal profits of the supply chain and its members in two scenarios. Further, we discuss the problem of supply chain coordination when adopting the blockchain technology. The results show that it is conditional for the supply chain to adopt the blockchain technology, and the condition is related to the traceability awareness of consumers, the production costs of the supplier and manufacturer, and the cost of using the blockchain technology. We also find that under a certain condition, the revenue sharing contract can realize a Pareto improvement for the supply chain that adopts the blockchain technology.</td>

To overcome this, information should be packed into blocks. Blockchain technology is such a new enabling technology which links the blocks of information to form a chain with other blocks of similar information. A blockchain is a decentralized computation and information sharing platform which enables multiple authoritative domains, which do not trust each other, to cooperate, coordinate and collaborate in a rational decision-making process. Information on a blockchain existed as a shared and continuously reconciled database. The blockchain database do not store in single location. No centralized version of the information exists which becomes difficult to hack. It allows the digital information to be shared in a distributed environment but not to copy in a single location. It created a new backbone of a new type of Internet. Today, blockchain is finding applications in every field like finance, healthcare, economics and legal, etc. Blockchain provides benefits such as reimbursement of healthcare services, exchange of health data, clinical trials and supply chains. Blockchain has the ability to use the increasing amounts of available health data from traditional sources, electronic health records and other digital health applications as well as non-traditional sources. However, there are certain challenges that are preventing the large-scale deployment of this technology in healthcare. Blockchain has the potential to overcome challenges that exist in the healthcare industry such as interoperability, security, cost of maintenance, integrity, traceability and universal access. In this study, few challenges faced by the healthcare industry are reviewed, and the potentiality of blockchain to overcome the challenges is also studied.</td>

However, in the blockchain network, every peer maintains the same state of the ledger to view the complete history of transactions that leads to scalability issues in the blockchain network. To address the problem of scalability we propose an enhanced Bell–LaPadula model and categorized the peers and transactions in different clearance and security levels. The peers don’t have to maintain the complete history of transactions owing to the clearance level. To provide data security in the network we constructed a dynamic access control policies using a smart contracts. We test our model on a blockchain-based healthcare network.

      <td>Recently, blockchain technology has attracted much attention of the research community in several domains requiring transparency of data accountability, due to the removal of intermediate trust assumptions from third parties. One such application is enabling file sharing in blockchain enabled distributed cloud storage. Proxy re-encryption is a cryptographic primitive that allows such file sharing by re-encrypting ciphertexts towards legitimate users via semi-trusted proxies, without them learning any information about the underlying message. To facilitate secure data sharing in the distributed cloud, it is essential to construct efficient proxy re-encryption protocols. In this paper, we introduce the notion of proxy self re-encryption (SE-PRE) that is highly efficient, as compared to the existing PRE schemes in the literature. We show that our self encryption scheme is provably CCA secure based on the DLP assumption and our proxy re-encryption scheme with self encryption is CCA secure under the hardness of the Computational Diffie Hellman (CDH) and Discrete Logarithm (DLP) assumption. Our novel encryption scheme, called self encryption, has no exponentiation or costly pairing operation. Even the re-encryption in SE-PRE does not have such operations and this facilitates the service provider with efficiency gain.</td>

It’s true that blockchain has its roots in cryptocurrency applications and is still evolving for that purpose in the financial sector, but many other organisations across different industries are beginning to see the non-crypto use cases where this mechanism to record data that cannot be changed or reversed or apply as smart contracts (as a way to time-stamp transactions between parties) is becoming extremely relevant and purposeful. A variety of industry sectors, besides Finance, has undertaken the use of these distributed technologies and beneficial attributes of blockchain from the healthcare and pharmaceutical, real estate, retail and supply chain, legal and publishing. Organisations have flexible options to run blockchain as permissionless (anyone can join), permissioned (where those need to be invited) or hybrid (a consortium type) and whether data should be held on-chain or off-chain. With industry entering its fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) the addition of blockchain as a complimentary technology has its place and there are some industries very suited to the significant impact it may bring. Also, the advances of Internet of Things, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence has meant more pressures on potential impacts to data and the ripple effects that cyber-attacks may cause. This has also become complicated, as cyber-attacks have become much more sophisticated over recent years with the different configuration types and various industry sectors have suffered from a range of these different attack vectors, resulting in some devastating outcomes. These have manifested in the shape of ransomware, malware, manipulation methods, phishing and spear-phishing. Whilst data breaches are a serious incident, in most organisations, there is a growing concern regarding attacks that are designed to have a more destructive effect such as the Ukraine cyber-attack in 2015 that resulted in a shutdown of the power grid or the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017 that caused widespread chaos with healthcare institutions unable to carry out any tasks since access to data/systems was unavailable.</td>

So, we proposed a new and complete framework with cloud, fog, to secure configuration files with blockchain technology. Our framework considers the configuration files from SDN or NFV as an asset to secure with blockchain. By saving configuration files into blockchain, we can detect illegal changes occurred to configuration files after hacking attack. This study also focuses on expanding blockchain between the multiple service providers with ease to prevent waste of resources. This paper mainly provides opportunities for different could or companies to secure their assets by employing the power of blockchain and smart contracts.</td>

      <td>Broadcasting Steganography in the Blockchain</td>
      <td>Conventional steganography embeds secret data into an innocent cover object such as image and video. The resulting stego object will be sent to the desired receiver via an insecure channel. Though the channel monitor cannot distinguish between normal objects and objects containing hidden information, he has the ability to intercept and alter the objects so as to break down the covert communication. It inspires us to introduce new steganography in Blockchain in order to overcome the aforementioned problem since an attacker cannot tamper Blockchain data once a block was generated, meaning that, a receiver will always be able to fully retrieve the secret data with the secret key. For the proposed work, the miner serves as the steganographer, who embeds secret data into the transactions within a block during the process of generating the block. To secure the data embedding process within a block, we choose a part of transactions in a block according to a secret key, and embed the secret data by repeatable-address arrangement. Our analysis demonstrates that, it is difficult for an attacker to extract the embedded data. Since the miner collects normal transactions for generating a block and does not generate abnormal transactions, the data embedding process will not arouse suspicion, providing a high level of security.\n</td>

The present study aims to redefine the dam watershed as a smart dam and attempts to systematize the technology for flood prediction by integrating upstream sensing, dam inflow prediction, and a hydro-blockchain. In order to detect high water levels, we devise an upstream sensing method to observe the water level at the uppermost stream of a dam watershed, and summarize potential implementation hurdles. We also propose a hydro-blockchain configuration that provides a basis for the fair transaction of water rights. We implement a field study in the Kanto region, Japan, to observe the upstream water level using the devised water level sensor. We analyze the relationship between the measured water levels and the dam inflow and also analyze the response of the time difference. Furthermore, we propose a flood-feature extraction using a 20 year hydro-dataset of rainfall and water levels, and propose dam inflow prediction models using various time series machine learning algorithms. We demonstrate the application of our model results and discuss their usefulness.</td>

      <td>Cloud storage security has received widespread attention from industry and academia. When cloud data is damaged and tampered by various types of security attacks, it is one of the most common methods to track accidents through log analysis. In order to support credible forensic analysis of user operation behavior logs in a shared cloud environment allowing multiple users handling data, this paper presents a secure and efficient public auditing scheme for user operation behavior logs. Specifically, a blockchain-based logging strategy was designed to support selective verification of log-data integrity and resist collusion attacks between malicious users and the cloud service provider. Based on the multi-user logging strategy, a public auditing approach was further presented to verify the integrity of log data in the cloud remotely without leaking any log content. We formally prove the security of the presented scheme and evaluate its performance by theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments. The results indicate that our scheme can achieve secure and effective auditing for logs in the shared cloud storage.\n</td>

Blockchains, however, make such an implementation possible. In a small case study, this paper demonstrates three related approaches how an example taxi dispatcher application involving independent parties can be modeled for implementation on a blockchain: BPMN with an extension for multi-party interactions, synchronized state-machines, and high-level Petri nets, respectively. The three models differ in how well they (a) align with the code in order to support model-driven engineering and (b) support readability of the contractual aspects of the chaincode to business stakeholders. We have implemented and tested the example application as chaincode on Hyperledger Fabric. Our preliminary results suggest that chaincode can be aligned with a high-level model of synchronized state machines which, in turn, can be easily visualized, for example, by an extended BPMN notation.\n</td>

In addition, the effect of applying blockchain platforms on a case study is presented and analyzed from performance and security level. The analysis aims to emphasize that blockchain, as presented in this paper, is a viable solution to the challenges in the CSC regardless of the risks associated with the security and robustness of the flow of information and data protection. Moreover, a threat analysis of applying a blockchain model on the CSC industry is introduced. This model indicates potential attacks and possible countermeasures to prevent the attacks. Future work is needed to expand, quantify, and optimize the threat model and conduct simulations considering proposed countermeasures for the different blockchain attacks outlined in this study.</td>

      <td>An exploratory study of smart contracts in the Ethereum blockchain platform</td>
      <td>Ethereum is a blockchain platform that supports smart contracts. Smart contracts are pieces of code that perform general-purpose computations. For instance, smart contracts have been used to implement crowdfunding initiatives that raised a total of US$6.2 billion from January to June of 2018. In this paper, we conduct an exploratory study of smart contracts. Differently from prior studies that focused on particular aspects of a subset of smart contracts, our goal is to have a broader understanding of all contracts that are currently deployed in Ethereum. In particular, we elucidate how frequently used the contracts are (activity level), what they do (category), and how complex they are (source code complexity). To conduct this study, we mined and cross-linked data from four sources: Ethereum dataset on the Google BigQuery platform, Etherscan, State of the DApps, and CoinMarketCap. Our study period runs from July 2015 (inception of Ethereum) until September 2018. With regards to activity level, we notice that it is concentrated on a very small subset of the contracts. More specifically, only 0.05% of the smart contracts are the target of 80% of the transactions that are sent to contracts. New solutions to cope with Ethereum’s limited scalability should take such an activity imbalance into consideration. With regards to categories, we highlight that the new and widely advertised rich programming model of smart contracts is currently being used to develop very simple applications that tend to be token-centric (e.g., ICOs, Crowdsales, etc). Finally, with regards to code complexity, we observe that the source code of high-activity verified contracts is small, with at most 211 instructions in 80% of the cases. These contracts also commonly include at least two subcontracts and libraries in their source code. The comment ratio of these contracts is also significantly higher than that of GitHub top-starred projects written in Java, C++, and C#. Hence, the source code of high-activity verified smart contracts exhibit particular complexity characteristics compared to other popular programming languages. Further studies are necessary to uncover the actual reasons behind such differences. Finally, based on our findings, we propose an open research agenda to drive and foster future studies in the area.</td>

      <td>Blockchain is a disruptive technology that relies on the distributed nature of the peer-to-peer network while performing an agreement, or consensus, a mechanism to achieve an immutable, global, and consistent registry of all transactions. Thus, a key challenge in developing blockchain solutions is to design the consensus mechanism properly. As a consequence of being a distributed application, any consensus mechanism is restricted to offer two of three properties: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. In this paper, we survey the main consensus mechanisms on blockchain solutions, and we highlight the properties of each one. Moreover, we differentiate both deterministic and probabilistic consensus mechanisms, and we highlight coordination solutions that facilitate the data distribution on the blockchain, without the need for a sophisticated consensus mechanism.</td>

      <td>Survey on Blockchain Consensus Strategies</td>
      <td>Blockchain is a distributed data store that offers a trusted infrastructure for mutually distrusting parties to network and transact, eliminating the need of any central authority or third party intermediary. The trust element in blockchain is due to the tamper proof record keeping in blockchain through efficient hashed block-linking mechanism and the consensus protocol among the network peers to create any new record in the distributed ledger. The consensus mechanism in distributed data store ensures that every participant node in the network accepts on a common agreement over a transaction or state transition in a system by gathering confirmation from all or at-least majority of the members. Usually some form of voting or lottery mechanism is employed for the leader election process to implement consensus among the participants in a business network. Consensus mechanism is also responsible for the smooth functioning of the distributed network in the event of some arbitrary faults or node failures or even any malicious attacks in the network. Generally a consensus mechanism implementation is a tailored solution based on application or use case. It ensures the correctness of data in the trusted distributed ledger through the peer agreement process. In this work, we explore the evolution of state of the art consensus protocols for various blockchain implementations, their application, advantages and drawbacks as well.</td>

Even though decentralization, each node within the blockchain network implements a storage mechanism to keep track of the blockchain states. In this paper, we perform a detailed study of selected blockchain platforms in order to discover which underlying database solutions they use to store blockchain states. Our results show that 13 out of 20 platforms use key-value stores (LevelDB or RocksDB), write-optimized storage solutions able to perform fast lookups due to their underlying indexing structure used.

Moreover, the electoral process in many countries is characterized by massive rigging, high cost of electoral materials, and declaration of false results. In this paper, we will present a review of the blockchain Technology and some of the potential roles to play in conducting a transparent election. This paper opines that with the emergence of the blockchain technology, African Nations should tap from it and build a reliable, secure, and convenient electoral voting system. It further suggests that a blockchain electoral voting system will eliminate most of the challenges faced by African nations in conducting a free, fair and transparent election with low cost and total security. The issue of election rigging is almost completely eradicated with this technology (if properly installed). An attempt to alter/manipulate records (votes) in the system’s database can be spotted easily, because of its rigorous consensus rules, such an attempt is considered void and denied permission to access, alter, or destroy any of the previously saved votes. However, the paper argues that there are institutional challenges to implementing this technology within the continent. Specifically, there is a need to educate the masses as well as create robust policies that can accommodate this technology within the continent. Failure to acknowledge these challenges may well prevent the application of blockchain technology in African electoral process in the foreseeable future.</td>

Based on the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), blockchain applications provides a breakthrough and innovative solutions due to the security they offer to the participants of the network, the efficiency of record keeping and transaction execution, and the automation solutions in terms of executing contracts when certain conditions are met (smart contracts). Despite the fact that most literature concerning blockchain focuses on its use in the finance industry and cryptocurrencies, there is a growing interest in the ways that this technology could be applied in other industries and management processes as well, both in the private and the public sector. In this paper, we are going to review the main propositions and findings in the literature concerning the use of blockchain technology in tourism and tourism marketing. We identify potential uses of blockchain in the tourism and hospitality industry in general and outline the benefits derived, and the challenges that will arise from the adoption of this innovative technology. Finally, we point out some direction for future research on the topic.</td>

      <td>Blockchain Technology in Healthcare Domain: Applications and Challenges</td>
      <td>\nBlockchain is a technology which is proposed to address various problems in different domains as like in the banking sector, supply chain. Blockchain is distributed public ledger that can hold permanent records in a secured way. Blockchain ensures that transactions can never be modified. Blockchain also provide data transparency, integrity, security and interoperability. To address the need for patients to manage and control their electronic health records, blockchain technology could be successfully applied in the healthcare sector. Using blockchain decentralized storage of patient information is possible. Health records which are up to date will be accessed by authenticated user only. It is possible for patient to share his records with other doctors for diagnosis of diseases for example chronological disease, thus blockchain provides personal data transaction in health care sector using blockchain. In this paper we reviewed different applications of blockchain in healthcare system and also challenges for deployment of this technology in healthcare industry.</td>

      <td>Digital transformation is continuously changing ecosystems, which also forces established companies to re-evaluate their value proposition. However, only transformations of single ecosystems have been studied. Therefore, this work targets to examine the similarities of digital transformation in five platform ecosystems: automotive, blockchain, financial, insurance, and IIoT. For our analysis, we combine the strengths of conceptual modeling using e3 value with a cluster analysis based on text mining to identify similarities in the respective ecosystems. As a result, we identified 15 clusters. Cluster 01 is the core cluster, containing the roles of organizations from all five ecosystems. Cluster 02–05 are intertwined, as they include roles from at least two ecosystems. Clusters 06–15 are ecosystem-specific that only include roles found in one ecosystem. Scholars and practitioners can use these clusters when analyzing or building a new platform ecosystem, or transforming a traditional ecosystem towards a platform ecosystem.</td>

      <td>Disintermediation in medical tourism through blockchain technology: an analysis using value-focused thinking approach</td>
      <td>Medical tourism (MT) is a promising industry that has shown significant growth in the past few decades. Patients often travel abroad to seek treatment, conventional and otherwise due to a myriad of reasons. The reasons include but are not limited to rising costs in their home country, experimental treatments only available abroad or better standards of care. However, MT has also created room for intermediaries to grow. These intermediaries are known as medical tourism facilitators (MTF), and as the name suggests, they provide patients services to make their experience easier and more convenient. MTFs often under deliver on their claims to the detriment of the patient. Given the varying legal jurisdiction, the sensitive nature of the healthcare process, and the arduous process of seeking and claiming settlements, most medical tourists are unlikely to pursue cases where they have been cheated. To understand the system of MT and the key issues faced by stakeholders, we used Value Focussed Thinking (VFT). VFT assists to arrive at the fundamental objectives that need to be addressed for mitigating these problems of MT. Based on the findings of VFT; we present a linkage or equivalence between the fundamental objectives for mitigating the problems of MT through Blockchain Technology. We present our findings on how Blockchain Technology can assist to increase disintermediation, transparency, and trust by bringing in aspects of optimizing time and efforts; optimizing expense required to settle disputes, automating disbursement of payments and enforcing mutually accepted agreements among other benefits.</td>

      <td>Application of Blockchain Technology in the Integration of Management Accounting and Financial Accounting</td>
      <td>Blockchain is one of the most popular technologies nowadays. The birth of blockchain technology has solved the problem of reliability of accounting data. The accounting industry should seize the opportunity and actively use blockchain technology to promote industry innovation. At the same time, accounting professionals must also improve their professionalism to adapt to industry changes. The two major branches of modern accounting, financial accounting and management accounting, have become disconnected in practice. Both of them need to rely on different information processing systems for their actual operation. This is not economical for the enterprise, and it is also not conducive to management accounting to play its function of serving the economic management of the enterprise. To this end, the in-depth analysis of the differences between management accounting and financial accounting, and the introduction of “enterprise economic value added”, the unification of the theoretical differences between the two is of great significance to the development of the accounting field. This paper introduces the current research status of accounting information distortion and accounting fraud through the review and analysis of domestic and foreign literatures. Based on the research purpose of this article, it analyzes the characteristics and advantages of blockchain technology, and the impact of blockchain technology on the accounting industry The current status of research on the impact of issues such as research has determined the research theme, ideas, and methods. It also expounds the theoretical basis that will be used to study and build the credibility guarantee mechanism of the accounting information system based on blockchain technology, and then defines and divides the related concepts. This paper uses the basic principles of blockchain, information asymmetry theory, and moral hazard as the theoretical basis. Through questionnaire surveys, it is believed that the current accounting information system makes the original transaction information and the accounting information processing process unreliable, and the quality is worrying. The study found that only 14.5% of the qualified accountants in the experiment. The extreme shortage of accountants, especially senior accounting professionals, is the primary factor restricting the implementation of advanced management accounting methods in China on a large scale.</td>

      <td>Blockchain, often treated as a next transforming general-purpose technology (GPT), might have the potential to revolutionize economic, political and social structures in the subsequent years. However, the actual impact of Blockchain will ultimately depend on the pace and direction of its diffusion process throughout the economy. Being currently in the nascent phase, the diffusion process of Blockchain remained largely neglected in the academic literature so far. The study at hand covers this research gap by investigating the forces affecting Blockchain diffusion leading to its materialization as a GPT. Identified from the broad literature on technological change, the various factors influencing diffusion patterns of GPTs are conceptualized in a framework of three interrelated groups: advancements in the GPT itself, advancements in its application sectors, and environmental factors. This conceptual framework is then applied to structure the current studies of Blockchain technology and reveal unexplored blind spots. In such a way, the present paper serves as a basis for further research on diffusion patterns of Blockchain and its materialization as a general-purpose technology.</td>

      <td>HRM smart contracts on the blockchain: emulated vs native</td>
      <td>In the past years numerous scandals in hiring processes of public institutions revealed significant weaknesses of the existing process. This lead to a lose of trust of citizens and applicants in these processes. Besides that, even honest processes often lack transparency for applicants, the company and, in the case of public institutions, also for citizens. Distributed ledger technology has been used in numerous past projects to establish trust between entities. Especially smart contracts have been a useful tool to execute programs in this setting. Thus, in the context of this project we developed an approach based on smart contracts to decentralize this process and improve its transparency and reliability. We enhance the system with game theory mechanics to encourage reviewers and candidates to participate honestly, further increasing the likelihood of a fair selection process. Nonetheless, not all blockchains support smart contracts and their usage comes with an elevated additional monetary cost. Due to that, in the blockchain environment, many businesses only emulate smart contracts by executing them on external servers which improves the scalability but decreases the decentralization. In the context of this, we compare the advantages and disadvantages of emulating smart contracts compared to native smart contracts in our concrete usage example. Our approach, compared to existing solutions, can be employed on any distributed ledger which allows to store some sort of metadata on the chain resulting in a significantly lower creation and maintenance cost (up to 30 times cheaper). The developed solution and discussion gives useful insight into safety and cost considerations which have to be made when deciding between native and emulated smart contracts.</td>

      <td>Ping-Pong Governance: Token Locking for Enabling Blockchain Self-governance</td>
      <td>Updating blockchain-based protocols remains a significant challenge. If the community does not come to an agreement, a hard-fork can occur, splitting the blockchain’s community. Previous protocols have provided mechanisms to establish community consensus through the protocol itself, but these protocols either facilitate substantial, infrequent updates, or they allow more frequent but only minor changes. This work offers a mechanism that allows clients to vote by locking tokens, making the clients’ tokens temporarily unavailable in exchange for their vote. This design introduces an economic cost to voting, allowing us to measure both breadth and depth of support. Since there is an economic cost to voting, we wish to make non-contentious issues cheap to pass, but still allow the community to establish agreement on larger, more disputatious proposals. We achieve this property by a ping-pong governance model. An issue is tentatively accepted when it achieves enough votes within a fixed period. The proposal then enters a review period, where the opponents must gather enough votes to veto it. The supporters then have their own opportunity to overrule the veto. This process continues with new voting rounds until one side is unable to exceed the needed threshold, settling the issue. Our simulations show that this model allows the community to come to agreement quickly on popular changes, but still come to resolution when the community is more divided. Finally, we define the ideal properties of a blockchain governance protocol, and evaluate different governance protocols under these criteria.</td>

In the proposed architecture, in addition to securing the taxpayers’ information on these private Blockchain systems, the taxpayers’ filed tax returns are verified instantaneously on the fly. In this verification process, the system retrieves the taxpayers’ information from the employers’, financial institutions’ and all other appropriate institutions’ private Blockchain systems.

      <td>During the last decade, the sharing economy has given birth to a number of market mediators, which have grown to become the world’s most valuable companies. Centralized sharing platforms like Uber, Didi Chuxing, and Airbnb have transformed several traditional industries. However, with the rise of the blockchain technology, some voices predict that these platform companies will soon be at risk of being disrupted themselves. In this chapter, we address the question of whether blockchain technology has given birth to a new breed of sharing economy platforms that can challenge the incumbents’ business models. We identify five different stages of the application of blockchain technology in emerging home sharing startups. We use a stage model to explain the differences among various types of platforms, from which we derive the impact of their differences on potential market success. However, in the home sharing sector, simply copying Airbnb’s business model and rebuilding it with blockchain technology is not sufficient for any of the emerging startups to overcome the prevalent barriers to entry. Hence, we use our results to illustrate whether and under what conditions blockchain-based startups might be able to “change the game” in the home sharing economy. Our results indicate that most blockchain-based home sharing startups will likely not be able to truly challenge the incumbent platforms. Nevertheless, by analyzing the different ways of blockchain implementation in the home sharing sectors, we identify several critical factors that may increase the chance to prosper for emerging blockchain home sharing networks.</td>

Currently, UAV having various vulnerabilities and hacked by a different set of skilled persons. In this paper, we outline security requirements for UAANET along with the existing attacks. Before giving any security solution, we first deeply understand common possible Attacks and their impact on society. We presented UAANET general security limitations and challenges with the existing solutions by Blockchain Technology. The Blockchain technology uses the combination of cryptography, a consensus algorithm, and a distributed ledger to create a decentralized trustworthy platform. In addition, open research issues are also discussed.</td>

      <td>The next definitive step into the future is expected to involve a shift towards a fully automated environment that utilizes exponential technology such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Sensor Networks and Blockchain paradigms. We are immersed in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, that is fundamentally changing the way we live, work and interact with one another, and with technology. Industry 4.0 is an emerging era of connectivity and interaction among parts, machines and humans that have the potential to create enormous production and efficiency dividends, in addition to improvements in the quality of life and sustainable environmental outcomes. The Healthcare Industry is in the process of adopting technologies that allow digitization of health records and automation of various plausible clinical procedures. The field has undergone an evolution of its own, and is now standing at Healthcare Version 3.0, the extension of Web 3.0, that involves greater transparency of healthcare data to individuals, personalized to optimize their experience with the interface. The amalgamation of the two revolutions to realise the new era of Health 4.0, is where the emerging Blockchain Technology could play a major role. The need for interoperability across clinical departments within the same hospital, the necessity of updated set of records for reference across multiple healthcare facilities, and the exigency of trusted and transparent documentation of individual health data, urge the use of Blockchain concepts in our attempt to transform healthcare services. This chapter explores the transition of the Healthcare Industry, the drawbacks of previous versions, and the opportunities of Blockchain concepts that would aid the medical field in keeping up with Industry 4.0.</td>

By completely decoupling the certificate authority portion of a PKI and storing certificate data inside smart contracts, the proposed method yields a sizable performance boost while decreasing the attack surface. Second, we propose a dynamic runtime sharding of Tendermint, which is an in-development state machine replication algorithm that uses the blockchain model to provide Byzantine-fault tolerance.

      <td>The blockchain technology emerged in 2008 as a distributed peer to peer network structure, capable of ensuring security for transactions made using the Bitcoin digital currency, without the need for third party intermediaries to validate them. Although its beginning was linked to cryptocurrencies, its use has diversified over the recent years. There are various projects using the blockchain technology to perform document validation, electronic voting, tokenization of non-perishable goods, and many others. With its increasing use, concern arises with possible attacks that could threaten the integrity of the consensus of the chain. One of the well-known attacks to the blockchain consensus mechanism is the selfish mining attack, in which malicious nodes can deflect their behavior from the standard pattern by not immediately disclosing their newly mined blocks. This malicious behavior can result in a disproportionate share of rewards for those nodes, especially if they have a significant processing power. The goal of this paper is to present a simple heuristic to detect the presence of selfish mining attack (and variants) in blockchain networks that use the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm. The proposal is to signal when the blockchain fork height deviates from the standard, indicating when the network is under the influence of such attacks.</td>

This paper covers the challenges it faces in implementing blockchain technology. The paper highlights how BCT is addressing key issues such as speedily and securely transmission of data, value to and from various transaction partners, cost of processing payments, new products, and services creation. The paper also covers various advantages brought out by BCT such as automate verification process and eliminating the need for multiple parties to confirm manual validity of transactions. With the advent of BCT, India’s banking and financial systems can be expected to transform the banking process to a new level. This study covers the field investigation as to how existing BCT is helping banks to effectively and efficiently monitor and control the banking process. The respondents were leading banking institutions and FinTech firms in the country. The study result shows that some of the Indian banks have already started their journey in using BCT and they got the benefits. However, they are facing certain challenges in the adaptation and implementation of this new technology. The legal and standardization issues need to be looked into with regards to jurisdictions in cross border transactions and interoperability between different BCT systems. Banks are currently using permission based BCT solutions for very defined (small) eco-system because of the data security reasons. It is like but not exactly the ‘WhatsApp’ group system wherein an administrator decides on membership of the group. However, for each bank, the considerations will differ for the ecosystem required to deploy the BCT solution. The study covers only leading banks and FinTech companies in the country and smaller players in the banking sector. In India financial institutions are at various stages of BCT adoption. They have already seen the benefits of BCT in some processes where BCT is put into use. With time to come with full implementation, BCT will change the picture of banking in India. With BCT the banking processes will be more transparent, faster and cost-effective with elimination of intermediaries. The key benefits will be decentralisation, trust, and security in transactions.</td>

      <td>Potential and limits of Blockchain technology for networked businesses</td>
      <td>New ways to organize economic activities are emerging, facilitated by Blockchain technology or the broader term Distributed Ledger Technology. Blockchains consist of dynamic shared ledgers that can be applied to ensure transparency and traceability and to save time when recording transactions between parties, remove costs associated with intermediaries (or, according to Nakamoto (2008), remove the need for intermediaries altogether), while enabling the introduction of pseudonymous parties on the Internet. First, and probably the most known application of blockchain technology, is cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin. It has taken businesses and industries some time to recognize that the underlying technology of Bitcoin could be the next wave for disruption of their existing business models. All too often, the focus of the media coverage is on the connection of cyber-currencies to criminal activities or on the highly speculative nature of their exchange rates and issues with coin exchanges.In this Special Issue, we qualify this disruptive potential, as we recognize that Blockchain technology has much broader and deeper applications than “just” currencies. We take a broad and neutral view on the technology and consider it a facilitator for new coordination mechanisms for networked businesses. The transparency of the system and the assurance that all participants will play by the rules takes the “markets versus hierarchies” discussion to the next level, when electronic markets can be created that are not governed by a single centralized entity, but rather by the community they serve and that might exist only in the virtual space – implemented as “Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)”, where “the code is the entire company” (Diedrich 2016). This might very well lead to completely different roles for current players, if not extinction.Blockchains might thus facilitate and contribute to other disruptive innovations, such as the sharing economy, the circular economy as well as smart grids that help businesses and private households to become independent in their energy provisioning. The challenge for scientists now is to distinguish between the hype and the core value of this phenomenon, to reason about and to reflect on the business potential, including the potential to disrupt trusted business models, but also to address some of the deeper technical foundations such as scalability, accountability, and security. This is the time for research to explore descriptive, explanatory and design research questions on Blockchain technology.</td>

      <td>Blockchain is an emergent technology which enables the execution of collaborative business processes while ensuring trust by replacing central authority with cryptographic proof and distributed consensus. Thus, Blockchain technology can be used to find agreement between untrusted collaborating parties in business processes. However, temporal constraints of processes need more investigation. Indeed, Blockchain platforms do not offer means to represent nor to manage temporal constraints for business processes. Moreover, transaction completion time is not fixed, it can take from a few seconds to several minutes. In this paper, we include temporal constraints in smart contracts, which could mitigate the violation of time constraints, minimize the costly execution time, and avoiding thus financial penalties. To achieve this, we extend Caterpillar tool, which is the first open-source blockchain-based BPMN execution engine, to enable the automatic transformation of a large set of temporal constraints for business process model to smart contract code. We illustrate our approach with a use case, which we deploy in Ethereum Testnet.</td>

      <td>Blockchain, a Distributed Ledger Technology, is a disruptive and revolutionary technology that enables transacting data in a decentralized structure without the need for trusted central authorities. Many industries have taken steps to unleash the potential of blockchain technology, including the government sector, and early adopters are exploring the use of blockchain as one of the critical capabilities needed to create new business models and to radically transform government services and functions. However, despite this interest in adopting Blockchain technology, there is a lack of Blockchain frameworks or reference models/architecture that addresses government services in literature. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain model that can be adopted by governments to establish government-led blockchain ecosystem for government services. The blockchain model is proposed based on the outcomes of our analysis of permissioned blockchain platform, and analysis of blockchain powered housing rentals use case that is being implemented by the Dubai Government. The proposed blockchain model outcomes includes a blockchain governance structure, participants and roles definition, and network architecture design which explains the deployment options and components. We also explain the model lifecycle and blockchain services, and we shed the light on the security and performance of the model. The study also includes exploring many blockchain use cases used by governments through proofs of concept or prototypes. Our analysis of Hyperledger Fabric design features shows the platform’s relevance to government services and use cases. The Hyperledger Fabric analysis also identifies the platform’s actors, services, processes and data structure of Hyperledger Fabric.</td>

      <td>Algorithmic Analysis of Blockchain Efficiency with Communication Delay</td>
      <td>A blockchain is a distributed hierarchical data structure. Widely-used applications of blockchain include digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. This paper proposes an algorithmic approach to analyze the efficiency of a blockchain as a function of the number of blocks and the average synchronization delay. The proposed algorithms consider a random network model that characterizes the growth of a tree of blocks by adhering to a standard protocol. The model is parametric on two probability distribution functions governing block production and communication delay. Both distributions determine the synchronization efficiency of the distributed copies of the blockchain among the so- called workers and, therefore, are key for capturing the overall stochastic growth. Moreover, the algorithms consider scenarios with a fixed or an unbounded number of workers in the network. The main result illustrates how the algorithms can be used to evaluate different types of blockchain designs, e.g., systems in which the average time of block production can match the average time of message broadcasting required for synchronization. In particular, this algorithmic approach provides insight into efficiency criteria for identifying conditions under which increasing block production has a negative impact on the stability of a blockchain. The model and algorithms are agnostic of the blockchain’s final use, and they serve as a formal framework for specifying and analyzing a variety of non-functional properties of current and future blockchains.</td>

An essential factor for the success of a CT is the appropriate management of its participants and their personal data. According to the current regulations, collecting and using personal data from participants must comply with rigorous standards. Therefore, healthcare institutes need to obtain freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous consent before being able to collect the data. Some of the major limitations of the current technological solutions are the lack of control over the granularity of consent grants, as well as the difficulty of handling dynamic changes of consent over time. In this paper, we present SCoDES, an approach for trusted and decentralized management of dynamic consent in clinical trials, based on blockchain technology (BCT). The usage of blockchain provides a set of features that allow maintaining consent information with trust guarantees while avoiding the need for a dedicated or centralized third trusted party.

The specific challenge was to design a time/space efficient structure and mechanism of storing/retrieving genomic data access logs, based on MultiChain version 1.0.4 (https://www.multichain.com/).MethodsOur technique uses the MultiChain stream application programming interface (which affords treating MultiChain as a key value store) and employs a two-level index, which naturally supports efficient queries of the data for single clause constraints. The scheme also supports heuristic and binary search techniques for queries containing conjunctions of clause constraints, and timestamp range queries. Of note, all of our techniques have complexity independent of inserted data set size, other than the timestamp ranges, which logarithmically scale with input size.ResultsWe implemented our insertion and querying techniques in Python, using the MultiChain library Savoir (https://github.com/dxmarkets/savoir), and comprehensively tested our implementation across a benchmark of datasets of varying sizes. We also tested a port of our challenge submission to a newer version of MultiChain (2.0 beta), which natively supports multiple indices.ConclusionsWe presented creative and efficient techniques for storing and querying log file data in MultiChain 1.0.4 and 2.0 beta. We demonstrated that it is feasible to use a permissioned blockchain ledger for genomic query log data when data volume is on the order of hundreds of megabytes and query times of dozens of minutes is acceptable. We demonstrated that evolution in the ledger platform (MultiChain 1 to 2) yielded a 30%-40% increase in insertion efficiency.

The key used for the sanitization process is optimally tuned by a new hybrid algorithm termed Sea Lion Explored-Whale Optimization Algorithm, which is the combination of Whale Optimization Algorithm and Sea Lion Optimization Algorithm, respectively. The blockchain technology is assisted to handle the key generated by the nodes. Subsequently, the trustability of the node is evaluated under novel specifics “two-level evaluation process” with a rule-based and machine learning-based evaluation process. Finally, the performance of the proposed model is verified and proved over other conventional methods for certain measures.</td>

This low profile is misleading because (1) the consequences of privacy breaches can be as ominous as those of other data types, and more extensive, since they can affect blood relatives; and (2) the ability for a motivated individual, a particular group, or a nation’s government to conduct an effective attack has increased sharply in the past few years due to improvements in technology. The research community will benefit in the long run from characterizing privacy risks derived from genome data sharing, as well as developing and applying responsible, cost-effective solutions to mitigate these risks. The scientific community must be the first to recognize that, if biometrics such as fingerprints, iris or retinal images, and portraits are considered identifying information and thus redacted from publicly shared datasets, so should be genomes, exomes, and many other downstream data such as transcriptomes, proteomes, etc. It is important to understand that once genomes and related information are made accessible and thus linkable to other data, it is impossible to control what type of inferences can be obtained and what type of sensitive information can be inadvertently disclosed. On the other hand, it is possible to quantify risk and provide commensurate protections for data that are made available for research. Moreover, it is possible to engage the privacy technology community around the theme of responsible genomic data sharing. A growing community of genome privacy researchers has emerged in the past decade. Our purpose is to test the limits of technology that protects genome privacy, while promoting the development of practical strategies that control the risk but preserve the utility of the data as much as possible. The goal is to be proactive, as oppose to wait for a major scandal to set the whole community back for decades, potentially erasing decades of progress in genome analysis and scientific discoveries.The 5th iDASH Secure Genome Analysis Competition [4] was co-organized in 2018 by the University of California San Diego (UCSD), the University of Texas Science Center (UT Health) and Indiana University Bloomington. Continuing the success of past competitions, our aim was to scaling the protection of the security and privacy of analyses on increasingly large genomic datasets. Specifically, we focused on bridging theory and practice of computational algorithms via community participation. In 2018, we devised three competition tracks, which included (1) blockchain-based genomic dataset access logging (Track 1), (2) secure homomorphic encryption on Genome Wide Association Studies (Track 2), and (3) secure DNA segment searching (Track 3). These three tracks attracted 64 registered teams from 17 countries across America, Europe, and Asia. After 4.5 months of development, 17 teams submitted their solutions by the deadline. We evaluated the submissions in 1 month, using approximately 100 Virtual Machines (VMs). The team from Yale University won Track 1, a joint team from UT Health and UCSD and a joint team from Duality Technologies and Dana Farber Cancer Institute co-won Track 2. A joint team from Microsoft Research and Massachusetts Institute of Technology as well as a joint team from CNRS, ISAE and UQAM co-won Track 3. This special issue of BMC Medical Genomics highlights some most advanced methods and techniques reported during the competition for the three tracks.</td>

      <td>With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) and its influence in various use case scenarios, it can be expected that IoT services will create a global reach. Smart cities, smart grids, smart industries, smart wearables etc. are some examples of IoT services today. Besides all the benefits that IoT provide, security issues of these services and data generated by IoT are of major concern. Traditional security practices of authentication and authorization have been initially designed for security needs of centralized client/server models which are good to deal with human-machine interaction over the Internet. In centralized systems, normally devices and users are trusted for being in the same application domain. Moreover, such systems can become a bottleneck for a number of queries at the same time; or may become a single point of failure causing unavailability of connected devices that are totally relying on a single trusted party. This paper explores the IoT security issues and concerns. Moreover, it provides a review of centralized and decentralized IoT security solutions in terms of authentication and authorization. Additionally, it discusses how Blockchain technology can be leveraged to provide IoT security.</td>

      <td>Barriers to implementation of blockchain into supply chain management using an integrated multi-criteria decision-making method: a numerical example</td>
      <td>Information and product visibilities have been crucial in today’s supply chain processes, as economic, environmental and social sustainability concepts, which have been frequently focused on in recent years, prioritize the transparency of business processes. Blockchain technology, with continuously expanding application areas, has been revealed to be applicable in supply chain processes. On the other hand, integration of blockchain technology into supply chain processes will not be as smooth as estimated, since some challenges and constraints have already been identified. Therefore, companies aiming to integrate blockchain into supply chain processes should qualify and investigate each of these challenges. In the literature, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is no study addressing the issues arising during the integration process. Moreover, most studies related to blockchain technology have merely examined the positive aspects. This study, on the contrary, discusses the technologic, financial, organizational and environmental challenges that are confronted on a sectoral basis during the integration process. The fuzzy AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS methods, which are used in uncertainties and are capable of simultaneous multi-criteria evaluation, were employed. Furthermore, it is intended to produce a study that is of benefit to industrial actors by analyzing the findings related to the challenges merging during technological transformation. The outputs of this study are as follows: (i) High investment costs, data security and utility are important; (ii) integration is harder for the health and logistic sectors; (iii) the supply chains, which are less complicated, will be able to coordinate faster than the blockchain technology does. Consequently, the obtained results are evaluated, and strategic outputs are shared for the decision-makers aiming to integrate blockchain technology into the supply chain processes.</td>

      <td>Blockchain technologies have become increasingly popular and attracted great interest in recent years. Beyond the financial sector, blockchain technologies are promising for addressing the current limitations in food supply chain management. As blockchain adoption for food supply chains is still in an early stage, it is significant to have a thematic framework to systematically understand the processes, benefits, and challenges. This paper aims to explore the adoption of blockchain technologies in food supply chains with a thematic analysis. Desktop research is conducted, and data is collected from online databases, including news article (e.g. Factiva) and research paper databases (e.g. Web of Science). Then we carry out a qualitative thematic analysis, according to the investigation processes suggested by Creswell. Based on the thematic analysis, we identify seven first-order themes and two second-order themes in adoption processes; thirteen first-order themes, sixteen second-order themes, and five third-order themes in benefits; and fourteen first-order themes and five second-order themes in challenges. In addition, we discuss and propose how to improve blockchain adoption in food supply chains in practice.</td>

      <td>Traditional cloud-centric architectures for Internet-of-Things applications are being replaced by distributed approaches. The Edge and Fog computing paradigms crystallize the concept of moving computation towards the edge of the network, closer to where the data originates. This has important benefits in terms of energy efficiency, network load optimization and latency control. The combination of these paradigms with embedded artificial intelligence in edge devices, or Edge AI, enables further improvements. In turn, the development of blockchain technology and distributed architectures for peer-to-peer communication and trade allows for higher levels of security. This can have a significant impact on data-sensitive and mission-critical applications in the IoT. In this paper, we discuss the potential of an Edge AI capable system architecture for the Blockchain of Things. We show how this architecture can be utilized in health monitoring applications. Furthermore, by analyzing raw data directly at the edge layer, we inherently avoid the possibility of breaches of sensitive information, as raw data is never stored nor transferred outside of the local network.</td>

      <td>A Survey of Distributed Consensus Protocols for Blockchain Networks</td>
      <td>Since the inception of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technology have attracted an increasing interest from both academia and industry. Among various core components, consensus protocol is the defining technology behind the security and performance of blockchain. From incremental modifications of Nakamoto consensus protocol to innovative alternative consensus mechanisms, many consensus protocols have been proposed to improve the performance of the blockchain network itself or to accommodate other specific application needs. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review and analysis on the state-of-the-art blockchain consensus protocols. To facilitate the discussion of our analysis, we first introduce the key definitions and relevant results in the classic theory of fault tolerance which help to lay the foundation for further discussion. We identify five core components of a blockchain consensus protocol, namely, block proposal, block validation, information propagation, block finalization, and incentive mechanism. A wide spectrum of blockchain consensus protocols are then carefully reviewed accompanied by algorithmic abstractions and vulnerability analyses. The surveyed consensus protocols are analyzed using the five-component framework and compared with respect to different performance metrics. These analyses and comparisons provide us new insights in the fundamental differences of various proposals in terms of their suitable application scenarios, key assumptions, expected fault tolerance, scalability, drawbacks and trade-offs. We believe this survey will provide blockchain developers and researchers a comprehensive view on the state-of-the-art consensus protocols and facilitate the process of designing future protocols.</td>

      <td>Developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and distributed ledger technology (DLT) currently lead to lively debates in academia and practice. AI processes data to perform tasks that were previously thought possible only for humans. DLT has the potential to create consensus over data among a group of participants in untrustworthy environments. In recent research, both technologies are used in similar and even the same systems. This can lead to a convergence of AI and DLT, which in the past, has paved the way for major innovations of other information technologies. Previous work highlights several potential benefits of a convergence of AI and DLT but only provides a limited theoretical framework to describe upcoming real-world integration cases of both technologies. In this research, we review and synthesize extant research on integrating AI with DLT and vice versa to rigorously develop a future research agenda on the convergence of both technologies. In terms of integrating AI with DLT, we identified research opportunities in the areas of secure DLT, automated referee and governance, and privacy-preserving personalization. With regard to integrating DLT with AI, we identified future research opportunities in the areas of decentralized computing for AI, secure data sharing and marketplaces, explainable AI, and coordinating devices. In doing so, this research provides a four-fold contribution. First, it is not constrained to blockchain but instead investigates the broader phenomenon of DLT. Second, it considers the reciprocal nature of a convergence of AI and DLT. Third, it bridges the gap between theory and practice by helping researchers active in AI or DLT to overcome current limitations in their field, and practitioners to develop systems along with the convergence of both technologies. Fourth, it demonstrates the feasibility of applying the convergence concept to research on AI and DLT.</td>

The 5G technologies target to support diverse vertical applications by connecting heterogeneous devices and machines with drastic improvements in terms of high quality of service, increased network capacity and enhanced system throughput. However, 5G systems still remain a number of security challenges that have been mentioned by researchers and organizations, including decentralization, transparency, risks of data interoperability, and network privacy vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the conventional techniques may not be sufficient to deal with the security requirements of 5G. As 5G is generally deployed in heterogeneous networks with massive ubiquitous devices, it is quite necessary to provide secure and decentralized solutions. Motivated from these facts, in this paper we provide a state-of-the-art survey on the integration of blockchain with 5G networks and beyond. In this detailed survey, our primary focus is on the extensive discussions on the potential of blockchain for enabling key 5G technologies, including cloud computing, edge computing, Network Function Virtualization, Network Slicing, and D2D communications. We then explore and analyse the opportunities that blockchain potentially empowers important 5G services, ranging from spectrum management, data sharing, network virtualization, resource management to interference management, federated learning, privacy and security provision. The recent advances in the applications of blockchain in 5G Internet of Things are also surveyed in a wide range of popular use-case domains, such as smart healthcare, smart city, smart transportation, smart grid and UAVs. The main findings derived from the comprehensive survey on the cooperated blockchain-5G networks and services are then summarized, and possible research challenges with open issues are also identified. Lastly, we complete this survey by shedding new light on future directions of research on this newly emerging area.</td>
