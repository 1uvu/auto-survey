      <td>Using the security triad to assess blockchain technology in public sector applications</td>
      <td>Highlights •Blockchain technology has security, governance, and regulatory implications for government.•The Confidentiality-Integrity-Accessibility (CIA) provides useful insight for managers.•A major advantage of blockchain technology is non-reputability. AbstractThis conceptual paper explores the impact of blockchain technology on public sector processes through the lens of information security. It includes an overview of the evolution of e-government, a synopsis of existing applications of blockchain technology, and innovative blockchain developments. We utilize the Confidentiality-Integrity-Accessibility (CIA) triad to guide our discussion of the security, governance, and regulatory implications of this technology. Leveraging the CIA triad model, we provide context for public managers who may consider blockchain technologies, and we highlight certain advantages arising from the “non-reputability” of distributed ledgers.In particular, we highlight the advantages of blockchain technologies with regards to non-reputability to help public managers understand how to best leverage blockchain technology to transform operations.</td>

      <td>An Improved Consensus Mechanism for the Blockchain Based on Credit Rewards and Punishments</td>
      <td>In the traditional Proof of Stake (PoS), the share of the currency owned by the node, that is, the share of the equity, determines the probability that the node is selected as the representative node. In each round of the block generation, a node is selected as the creator of the next block by the verification, and the selected creator will pack appropriate transactions into the block and publish it on the blockchain. However, in the network with poor synchronization, the traditional PoS produces multiple verified representative nodes in each round, which generates multiple blocks. Then the blockchain is easy to produce the bifurcation. Aiming at the bifurcation problem of PoS, we propose an improved voting method based on credit rewards and punishments to vote on multiple blocks. The block is selected by considering the credibility of the creator, the count of the obtained comprehensive votes and the transaction value of the block. Thereby it can ensure the consistency and the fairness of the blockchain network. In the same time, the malicious node is found and voted to be removed in time by counting the number of invalid blocks generated by the nodes. It can ensure the security of the blockchain network.</td>

      <td>HyBloSE: hybrid blockchain for secure-by-design smart environments</td>
      <td>Although smart environments are a key component of the Internet of Things (IoT), it is also clear that billions connected doors, washing machines, ovens and others will ultimately raise security and privacy concerns. Early work in this area, as well as most of commercial solutions, has adopted a centralized client/server approach, neglecting the multitude of risks that are induced by an unfair control of the server side. This has made the adoption of a decentralized and trust-less framework quintessential to guarantee devices security. Nevertheless, decentralized proposals are hardly applicable due to costs, slowness and privacy issues. In this paper, we make the use of blockchain practical for smart environments by designing HyBloSE, a secure-by-design and lightweight blockchain-based framework, able to run on low-power devices without additional hardware. HyBloSE is built by using Delegated Proof of Authority and a Moving Window Blockchain. We evaluate HyBloSE through a network emulator and real experiments with different Raspberry Pi platforms. Results show that HyBloSE guarantees a higher security level in terms of resiliency to internal and external attacks compared to centralized solutions, with overhead below 0.38s per operation and less than $4 per month for unlimited operations. Furthermore, we show how Proof of Authority is more adapt then Proof of Work in IoT private scenarios.</td>

However, there still exist security vulnerabilities when registering products to a specific RFID tag, particularly regarding the ease at which tags can be cloned.

      <td>Utilizing Public Blockchains for the Sybil-Resistant Bootstrapping of Distributed Anonymity Services</td>
      <td>Distributed anonymity services, such as onion routing networks or cryptocurrency tumblers, promise privacy protection without trusted third parties. While the security of these services is often well-researched, security implications of their required bootstrapping processes are usually neglected: Users either jointly conduct the anonymization themselves, or they need to rely on a set of non-colluding privacy peers. However, the typically small number of privacy peers enable single adversaries to mimic distributed services. We thus present AnonBoot, a Sybil-resistant medium to securely bootstrap distributed anonymity services via public blockchains. AnonBoot enforces that peers periodically create a small proof of work to refresh their eligibility for providing secure anonymity services. A pseudo-random, locally replicable bootstrapping process using on-chain entropy then prevents biasing the election of eligible peers. Our evaluation using Bitcoin as AnonBoot's underlying blockchain shows its feasibility to maintain a trustworthy repository of 1000 peers with only a small storage footprint while supporting arbitrarily large user bases on top of most blockchains.</td>

      <td>SMChain: a scalable blockchain protocol for secure metering systems in distributed industrial plants</td>
      <td>Metering is a critical process in large-scale distributed industrial plants, which enables multiple plants to collaborate to offer mutual services without outside interference. When distributed plants measure the data from a shared common source, e.g., flow metering in an oil pipeline, trustworthiness and immutability must be guaranteed among them. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical and scalable blockchain-based secure metering system, SMChain, to provide strong security, trustworthy guarantee, and immutable services. SMChain adopts a two-layer blockchain structure, consisting of independent local blockchains stored at individual plants and one state blockchain stored in the cloud. To deal with the scalability issues within each plant, we propose a novel scalable Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus protocol based on (k, n)-threshold signature scheme to deal with the Byzantine faults and reduce the intra-plant communication complexity from O(n2) to O(n). For the state blockchain, we use a cloud-based service to synchronize and integrate the local blockchains into one state blockchain, which can further be distributed back to each plant.</td>

      <td>The data collected by IoT devices is of great value, which makes people urgently need a secure device key management strategy to protect their data. Existing works introduce the blockchain technology to transfer the responsibility of key management from the trusted center in the traditional key management strategy to the devices, thus eliminating the trust crisis caused by excessive dependence on third parties. However, the lightweight implementation of IoT devices limits the ability to resist side channel attacks, causing the private key to be exposed and subject to masquerading attacks. Accordingly, we strengthen the original blockchain based key management scheme to defend against key exposure attack. On the one hand, we introduce two hash functions to bind transactions in the blockchain to legitimate users. On the other hand, we design a secure key exchange protocol for identifying and exchanging access keys between legitimate users. Security analysis and performance show that the proposed scheme improves the robustness of the network with small storage and communication overhead increments.</td>

A decentralized network that encourages the internet to operate from the smartphone or tablet of anybody instead of centralized servers. A decentralized implementation would be based on a peer-to-peer network that is dependent on a user community. Their machines connected to the internet will host the network, not a community of more powerful servers. Each site would be distributed across thousands of nodes on various devices. The data is therefore not contained, owned by private storage facilities. There is therefore no central point to hack, and no way for an oligarchy of entities to take control of it. A proposed alternative was formed based on a systematic literature review that demonstrates that Internet decentralization is what this modern technology needs in order to address not only the weaknesses of current servers including server down issue, hacking and data manipulation or single point of failure, but also to prevent companies from monetizing the data of citizens through their server and to market them to the advertisers.</td>

      <td>Protecting and securing data that reside at various hosts in the Internet has become more important than ever before because of the growing number of cyber attacks. Though there have been several studies related to denial of service and cache attacks, those studies are primarily based on simulations and investigations of attacks on real networks are still lacking.In this paper, we experimentally investigated the effects of cache attacks on blockchain based information-centric networks. We used the hyperledger fabric to implement the blockchains for small and medium-sized networks. We implemented cache attacks where the attacker target the cache with unpopular content, forcing the user to fetch the data from the web servers. We experimented with two different topologies (linear and mesh) and also considered two cache sizes at the nodes. Three cache replacement policies were used: Least Recently Used, Random, and First In First Out. The cache hit, time taken to get the data, and the number of hops to serve the request were obtained with real network traffic. On the hyperledger fabric framework, we implemented two types of requests and showed how the query delay, invoke delay, and update delay vary with time. Based on our results, we find that most of the information centric networks, including the ones based on blockchains, are vulnerable to cache attacks.</td>

      <td>Practical UC-Secure Delegatable Credentials with Attributes and Their Application to Blockchain</td>
      <td>Certification of keys and attributes is in practice typically realized by a hierarchy of issuers. Revealing the full chain of issuers for certificate verification, however, can be a privacy issue since it can leak sensitive information about the issuer's organizational structure or about the certificate owner. Delegatable anonymous credentials solve this problem and allow one to hide the full delegation (issuance) chain, providing privacy during both delegation and presentation of certificates. However, the existing delegatable credentials schemes are not efficient enough for practical use.In this paper, we present the first hierarchical (or delegatable) anonymous credential system that is practical. To this end, we provide a surprisingly simple ideal functionality for delegatable credentials and present a generic construction that we prove secure in the UC model. We then give a concrete instantiation using a recent pairing-based signature scheme by Groth and describe a number of optimizations and efficiency improvements that can be made when implementing our concrete scheme. The latter might be of independent interest for other pairing-based schemes as well. Finally, we report on an implementation of our scheme in the context of transaction authentication for blockchain, and provide concrete performance figures.</td>

      <td>The exponential growth of wireless-based solutions, such as those related to the mobile smart devices (e.g., smart-phones and tablets) and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, has lead to countless advantages in every area of our society. Such a scenario has transformed the world a few decades back, dominated by latency, into a new world based on an efficient real-time interaction paradigm.Recently, cryptocurrency have contributed to this technological revolution, the fulcrum of which are a decentralization model and a certification function offered by the so-called blockchain infrastructure, which make it possible to certify the financial transactions, anonymously. However, it should be observed how this challenging scenario has generated new security problems directly related to the involved new technologies (e.g., e-commerce frauds, mobile bot-net attacks, blockchain DoS attacks, cryptocurrency scams, etc.). In this context, we can acknowledge that the scientific community efforts are usually oriented toward specific solutions, instead to exploit all the available technologies, synergistically, in order to define more efficient security paradigms. This paper aims to indicate a possible approach able to improve the security of people and things by introducing a novel paradigm to security defined Internet of Entities (IoE). It is a mechanism for the localization of people and things, which exploits both the huge number of existing wireless-based devices and the blockchain-based distributed ledger technology, overcoming the limits of traditional localization approaches, but without jeopardizing the user privacy. Its operation is based on two core elements with interchangeable roles, entities and trackers, which can be very common elements such as smart-phones, tablets, and IoT devices, and its implementation requires minimal efforts thanks to the existing infrastructures and devices.</td>

The cost of creating a 51% attack is surprisingly low if hash power is abundantly available. That posts a great threat to lots of PoW blockchains. We propose a technique to combine history weighted information of miners with the total calculation difficulty to alleviate the 51% attack problem.

      <td>A Hybrid Blockchain Architecture for Privacy-Enabled and Accountable Auctions</td>
      <td>Blockchain has recently emerged as an important tool that can enable critical distributed applications without requiring centralized trust. For example, public blockchains have been used to enable many different cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately, existing public blockchains and smart contracts deployed on them may disclose sensitive information. Although there is some ongoing work that leverage advanced cryptography to address some of these sensitive information leakage issues, they require significant changes to existing and popular blockchains such as Ethereum and are usually computationally expensive. On the other hand, private blockchains have been proposed to allow more efficient and privacy-preserving data sharing among pre-approved group of nodes/participants. Although private blockchains address some of the privacy challenges by allowing sensitive data to be only seen by the select group of participants, they do not allow public accountability of transactions since transactions are approved by known set of users, and cannot be accessed publicly. Given these observations, one natural question that arise is, can we leverage both public and private blockchain infrastructures to enable efficient, privacy enhancing and accountable applications? In this work, we try to address this challenge in the context of digital auctions. Mainly, we propose a novel hybrid blockchain architecture that combines private and public blockchains to allow sensitive bids to be opened on a private blockchain so that only the auctioneer can learn the bids, and no one else. At the same time, we leverage public blockchains to make the auction winner announcement, and payments accountable. Furthermore, using smart contracts deployed on public blockchain, we show how to incentivize truthful behavior among the auction participants. Our extensive empirical results show that this architecture is more efficient in terms of run time and monetary cost compared to pure public blockchain based auction implementations.</td>

      <td>Contract-Based Approach for Security Deposit in Blockchain Networks with Shards</td>
      <td>As a decentralized ledger technology, blockchain is considered to be a potential solution for applications with highly concentrated management mechanism. However, most of the existing blockchain networks are employed with the hash-puzzle-solving consensus protocol, known as proof-of-work. The competition of solving the puzzle introduces high latency, which directly leads to a long transaction-processing time. One solution of this dilemma is to establish a blockchain network with shards. In this paper, we focus on the blockchain network with shards and adopt the security-deposit based consensus protocol, studying the problem of how to balance the security incentive and the economic incentive. Also, the inherent features of the blockchain, i.e., anonymity and decentralization, introduce the information asymmetric issue between the beacon chain and the participants. The contract theory is utilized to formulate the problem between them. As such, the optimal rewards related to the different types of validators can be obtained, as well as the reasonable deposits accordingly. Compared with the fixed deposits, the flexible deposits can provide enough economic incentive for the participants without losing the security incentives. Besides, the simulation results demonstrate that the contract theory approach is capable of maximizing the beacon chain's utility and satisfying the incentive compatibility and individual rationality of the participants.</td>

      <td>Anti-Withholding Reward System to Secure Blockchain Mining Pools</td>
      <td>In decentralized blockchain systems such as Bitcoin, the miners are rewarded for generating new blocks and processing the transactions. In order to reduce the reward variance, the miners join mining pools where the miners aggregate their computational resources and divide the reward according to their contributions, measured by shares. The miner-based attacks such as Block Withholding (BWH) and Fork After Withholding (FAW) yield unfair reward advantages to the attackers at the expense of the other honest miners by having the attackers withhold blocks while still submitting the shares and pretending to contribute to the victim pool. This paper introduces Anti-Withholding Reward System (AWRS) to prevent FAW and BWH attacks. Implemented at the pool manager (reducing the adoption overhead and supporting backward-compatibility), AWRS deprives the incentive for FAW and BWH attacks by providing greater rewards to the block submissions. AWRS completely disincentivizes the FAW attack and reduces the optimal attacker's behavior to honest mining, making the withholding-based threats irrelevant for rational miners.</td>

      <td>Coin Hopping Attack in Blockchain-Based IoT</td>
      <td>With dramatic developments of blockchain technology, a number of blockchain-based applications emerge rapidly, among which the incorporation of blockchain into Internet of Things is one of the most valued research direction. Such powerful incorporation is a double-sided sword, i.e., it can benefit both individuals and society but has the vulnerability to coin hopping attack that is a new type of pool mining attack and hard to happen in traditional blockchain networks. In this paper, we theoretically prove the feasibility of coin hopping attack, deeply analyze the conditions of attack implementation, and comprehensively investigate the impacts of coin hopping attack. Moreover, some defense strategies are addressed. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first work targeting coin hopping attack.</td>

      <td>The Blockchain is an emerging paradigm that could solve security and trust issues for Internet of Things (IoT) platforms. We recently introduced in an IETF draft (“Blockchain Transaction Protocol for Constraint Nodes”) the BIoT paradigm, whose main idea is to insert sensor data in blockchain transactions. Because objects are not logically connected to blockchain platforms, controller entities forward all information needed for transaction forgery. Never less in order to generate cryptographic signatures, object needs some trusted computing resources. In previous papers we proposed the Four-Quater Architecture integrating general purpose unit (GPU), radio SoC, sensors/actuators and secure elements including TLS/DTLS stacks. These secure microcontrollers also manage crypto libraries required for blockchain operation. The BIoT concept has four main benefits: publication/duplication of sensors data in public and distributed ledgers, time stamping by the blockchain infrastructure, data authentication, and non repudiation.</td>

Blockchain can provide a good solution to the issue of secure message dissemination or secure information sharing in vehicular networks with a weak trust relationship among the nodes. In this paper, we investigate the design of a regional blockchain for VANETs, where the blockchain is shared among nodes in a geographically bounded area. We investigate how to design the regional blockchain while achieving a low 51% attack success probability. We derive a condition that guarantees a low 51% attack success probability in terms of the numbers of good nodes and malicious nodes, the message delivery time, and the puzzle computation time. The condition can provide a useful guideline for selection of several control parameters guaranteeing the stable operation of the blockchain. We run several simulations to show the validity of the condition and investigate the effects of various parameters on the 51% attack success probability. Our analysis and simulation results show that maintaining a low message delivery time for good nodes is very important in protecting the stability of the blockchain system.</td>

The severeness of the vulnerabilities can vary from launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack to entirely draining the batteries of a heart pacemaker. Although IoT providers constantly working on reducing the vulnerabilities, an Intrusion Detection (ID) system can be built to find, whether the nodes are behaving abnormally or not. ID system can be built with a centralized architecture, but compromising the centralized entity can result in compromising the entire network. For storing data and running ID system in a decentralized manner, blockchain technology is executed to increase trust between the peers. With this decentralized blockchain architecture each node will be able to find out whether the peers in the group are malicious or not. So, we propose a architecture, IDBIoT (Intrusion Detector for Blockchain based IoT networks) for Intrusion detection in an IoT environment, that mainly focuses on the securing the network by detecting intruders, using statistical significance while preventing Goldfinger attack.</td>

Towards that direction, the paper proposes the use of a trust-based blockchain in CIDNs, referred to as trust-chain, to protect the integrity of the information shared among the CIDN peers, enhance their accountability, and secure their collaboration by thwarting insider attacks. A consensus protocol is proposed for CIDNs, which is a combination of a proof-of-stake and proof-of-work protocols, to enable collaborative IDS nodes to maintain a reliable and tampered-resistant trust-chain.</td>

      <td>IoT devices or smart devices have become a part and parcel of the human existence. Every day, the counts of devices, which are being connected to the internet, are becoming unquantifiable. One among the prominent applications in commercial IoT is medical IoT. Privacy maintenance and ensuring security of user data is a major concern in certain scenarios such as that of the medical IoT. Conventionally the data generated from a sensor should be highly confidential and private. The centralized data management adopted in majority of IoT systems are having high set up cost and are prone to single point of failure and does not provide any guarantee of data authenticity and security. The inherent nature of IoT systems such as limited storage and low processing capabilities make them an unsuitable candidate for the use of complex and highly computational cryptographic algorithms. Even though the use of modern server platforms such as the AWS and Google helped in mitigating the issues of high setup cost and less security, the problems of data authenticity and access control still persists. Blockchain is a decentralized mechanism for secure management and exchange of data in any IoT system, particularly healthcare. Hence blockchain with its inherent properties of immutability, consensus mechanism, provenance and encryption can solve the problems of authenticity and access control in IoT. There exists several research works related to IoT security with the inclusion of blockchain framework. However, a collation of various works related to blockchain IoT is absent in the literature and this paper aims to provide a detailed amalgam of the wide range of works in blockchain IoT. We also aim to highlight the necessity of securing an IoT system and present a comparison of blockchain and other security techniques in terms of robustness, setup cost, risk of failure etc. and also propose an ideal security technique that can be adopted for IoT applications.</td>

      <td>Blockchain has flourished in recent years. As a decentralized system architecture, smart contracts give the blockchain a user-defined logical concept. The smart contract is an executable program that can be used for automatic transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. In 2016, the DAO attack resulted in the theft of 60M USD due to unsafe smart contracts. Smart contracts are vulnerable to hacking because they are difficult to patch and there is a lack of assessment standards for ensuring their quality. Hackers can exploit the vulnerabilities in smart contracts when they have been published on Ethereum. Thus, this study presents SoliAudit (Solidity Audit), which uses machine learning and fuzz testing for smart contract vulnerability assessment. SoliAudit employs machine learning technology using Solidity machine code as learning features to verify 13 kinds of vulnerabilities, which have been listed as Top 10 threats by an open security organization. We also created a gray-box fuzz testing mechanism, which consists of a fuzzer contract and a simulated blockchain environment for on-line transaction verification. Different from previous research systems, SoliAudit can detect vulnerabilities without expert knowledge or predefined patterns. We subjected SoliAudit to real-world evaluation by using near 18k smart contracts from the Ethereum blockchain and Capture-the-Flag samples. The results show that the accuracy of SoliAudit can reach to 90% and the fuzzing can help identify potential weaknesses, including reentrancy and arithmetic overflow problems.</td>

This paper aims to provide a first-time study on current formalization research on all smart contract-related platforms on blockchains, which is scarce in the literature. To this end, a timely and rigorous systematic review to examine the state-of-the-art research and achievements published between 2015 and July 2019 is provided. This study is based on a comprehensive review of a set of 35 research papers that have been extracted from eight major online digital databases. The results indicate that the most common formalization technique is theorem proving, which is most often used to verify security properties relating to smart contracts, while other techniques such as symbolic execution and model checking were also frequently used. These techniques were most commonly used to verify the functional correctness of smart contracts. From the language and automation point of views, there were 12 languages (domain specific/specification/general purpose) proposed or used for the formalization of smart contracts on blockchains, while 15 formal method-specific automated tools/frameworks were identified for mitigating various vulnerabilities of smart contracts. From the results of this work, we further highlight three open issues for future research in this emerging domain including: formal testing, automated verification of smart contracts, and domain specific languages (DSLs) for Ethereum. These issues suggest the need for additional, in-depth research. Our study also provides possible future research directions.</td>

Some users use Bitcoin for payment exchanges against any business while others use the Bitcoin network for earning Bitcoins itself, and there is also another type of user who called hackers those flood different types of attacks to illegally earn some Bitcoins or collapsing overall network. There are also numerous uses of blockchain technology, e.g. health, automation industry, energy sector, security and authentication in smart grids. In this study, we have elaborated on different critical aspects of Blockchain technology like its style of working mechanism, possible improvement suggestions by using Proof-of-Stake, and other custom variations, attempting seven types of challenges by different novel techniques. Moreover, we have also explained the current state-of-the-artwork in blockchain’s non-financial applications like Healthcare in which contribution of four-layered custom blockchain models related to precision medicine and the clinical trial was notable. Moreover, a mobile app model called HDG for the automation of medical records without compromising privacy was also a prominent contribution.</td>

One key question in this direction is the extent to which the transaction graph can serve as an early-warning indicator for large financial losses. In this article, we demonstrate the impact of extreme transaction graph activity on the intraday volatility of the Bitcoin prices series. Specifically, we identify certain sub-graphs (‘chainlets’) that exhibit predictive influence on Bitcoin price and volatility and characterize the types of chainlets that signify extreme losses. Using bars ranging from 15 min up to a day, we fit GARCH models with and without the extreme chainlets and show that the former exhibit superior value-at-risk backtesting performance.</td>

      <td>Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) utilizes an architecture that can host a large number of nodes without pre-established trust to provide decentralized services. The blockchain is the most widely used architecture of distributed ledger, where transactions across the whole network are visible to all participants in a chain to prevent tampering. However, transactions may contain sensitive information such as business contract. To secure the system and protect user privacy, we propose a multi-channel architecture that leverages Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX). We illustrate how SGX capabilities help to defend against attacks on distributed ledgers, by way of SGX enforcement on the participating machines. We adopt the design and implementation of a two layer architecture for securing the blockchain mining process and enhancing the transaction privacy. The security analysis and performance evaluation show that the design and protocols are capable of protecting privacy, defending against adversarial attacks and scalable.</td>

      <td>Most current digital currency schemes and associated ledgers are either centralized or completely distributed similar to the design adopted by Bitcoin. Centralized schemes enable accountability, but leave the privacy of users' identities and transactions in the hands of one organization. Distributed schemes can ensure better privacy but provide little accountability. In this paper we design a privacy-preserving proactively-secure distributed ledger and associated transaction protocols that can be used to implement an accountable digital currency that inherits the ledger's privacy and security features. One of the main technical challenges that we address is dealing with the increase in ledger size over time, an unavoidable aspect as the currency spreads and the ledger is required to be maintained for a long time in the future. We accomplish this by reducing the distributed (secret-shared) storage footprint and the required bandwidth and computation for proactively refreshing the ledger to ensure long-term confidentiality and security. In the full version, we provide performance analysis of some of the subprotocols to estimate the time required to perform transactions and the proactive refreshing of the ledger.</td>

      <td>General State Channel Networks</td>
      <td>One of the fundamental challenges that hinder further adaption of decentralized cryptocurrencies is scalability. Because current cryptocurrencies require that all transactions are processed and stored on a distributed ledger -- the so-called blockchain -- transaction throughput is inherently limited. An important proposal to significantly improve scalability are off-chain protocols, where the massive amount of transactions is executed without requiring the costly interaction with the blockchain. Examples of off-chain protocols include payment channels and networks, which are currently deployed by popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. A further extension of payment networks envisioned for cryptocurrencies are so-called state channel networks. In contrast to payment networks that only support off-chain payments between users, state channel networks allow execution of arbitrary complex smart contracts. The main contribution of this work is to give the first full specification for general state channel networks. Moreover, we provide formal security definitions and prove the security of our construction against powerful adversaries. An additional benefit of our construction is the use of channel virtualization, which further reduces latency and costs in complex channel networks.</td>

      <td>BLOCKBENCH: A Framework for Analyzing Private Blockchains</td>
      <td>Blockchain technologies are taking the world by storm. Public blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, enable secure peer-to-peer applications like crypto-currency or smart contracts. Their security and performance are well studied. This paper concerns recent private blockchain systems designed with stronger security (trust) assumption and performance requirement. These systems target and aim to disrupt applications which have so far been implemented on top of database systems, for example banking, finance and trading applications. Multiple platforms for private blockchains are being actively developed and fine tuned. However, there is a clear lack of a systematic framework with which different systems can be analyzed and compared against each other. Such a framework can be used to assess blockchains' viability as another distributed data processing platform, while helping developers to identify bottlenecks and accordingly improve their platforms.In this paper, we first describe BLOCKBENCH, the first evaluation framework for analyzing private blockchains. It serves as a fair means of comparison for different platforms and enables deeper understanding of different system design choices. Any private blockchain can be integrated to BLOCKBENCH via simple APIs and benchmarked against workloads that are based on real and synthetic smart contracts. BLOCKBENCH measures overall and component-wise performance in terms of throughput, latency, scalability and fault-tolerance. Next, we use BLOCKBENCH to conduct comprehensive evaluation of three major private blockchains: Ethereum, Parity and Hyperledger Fabric. The results demonstrate that these systems are still far from displacing current database systems in traditional data processing workloads. Furthermore, there are gaps in performance among the three systems which are attributed to the design choices at different layers of the blockchain's software stack. We have released BLOCKBENCH for public use.</td>

      <td>Empirical vulnerability analysis of automated smart contracts security testing on blockchains</td>
      <td>The emerging blockchain technology supports decentralized computing paradigm shift and is a rapidly approaching phenomenon. While blockchain is thought primarily as the basis of Bitcoin, its application has grown far beyond cryptocurrencies due to the introduction of smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-enforcing pieces of software, which reside and run over a hosting blockchain. Using blockchain-based smart contracts for secure and transparent management to govern interactions (authentication, connection, and transaction) in Internet-enabled environments, mostly IoT, is a niche area of research and practice. However, writing trustworthy and safe smart contracts can be tremendously challenging because of the complicated semantics of underlying domain-specific languages and its testability. There have been high-profile incidents that indicate blockchain smart contracts could contain various code-security vulnerabilities, instigating financial harms. When it involves security of smart contracts, developers embracing the ability to write the contracts should be capable of testing their code, for diagnosing security vulnerabilities, before deploying them to the immutable environments on blockchains. However, there are only a handful of security testing tools for smart contracts. This implies that the existing research on automatic smart contracts security testing is not adequate and remains in a very stage of infancy. With a specific goal to more readily realize the application of blockchain smart contracts in security and privacy, we should first understand their vulnerabilities before widespread implementation. Accordingly, the goal of this paper is to carry out a far-reaching experimental assessment of current static smart contracts security testing tools, for the most widely used blockchain, the Ethereum and its domain-specific programming language, Solidity, to provide the first body of knowledge for creating more secure blockchain-based software.</td>

      <td>EasyFlow: keep ethereum away from overflow</td>
      <td>While Ethereum smart contracts enabled a wide range of blockchain applications, they are extremely vulnerable to different forms of security attacks. Due to the fact that transactions to smart contracts commonly involve cryptocurrency transfer, any successful attacks can lead to money loss or even financial disorder. In this paper, we focus on the overflow attacks in Ethereum, mainly because they widely rooted in many smart contracts and comparatively easy to exploit. We have developed EasyFlow, an overflow detector at Ethereum Virtual Machine level. The key insight behind EasyFlow is a taint analysis based tracking technique to analyze the propagation of involved taints. Specifically, EasyFlow can not only divide smart contracts into safe contracts, manifested overflows, well-protected overflows and potential overflows, but also automatically generate transactions to trigger potential overflows. In our preliminary evaluation, EasyFlow managed to find potentially vulnerable Ethereum contracts with little runtime overhead. A demo video of EasyFlow is at https://youtu.be/QbUJkQI0L6o.</td>

      <td>Security Vulnerabilities in Ethereum Smart Contracts</td>
      <td>Smart contracts (SC) are one of the most appealing features of blockchain technologies facilitating, executing, and enforcing predefined terms of coded contracts without intermediaries. The steady adoption of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain has led to tens of thousands of contracts holding millions of dollars in digital currencies and small mistakes during the development of SC on immutable blockchains have already caused substantial losses and involve the danger for future incidents. Hence, today the secure development of smart contracts is an important topic and several attacks and incidents related to vulnerable smart contracts could have been avoided. To foster a secure development process of SC this paper summarizes known vulnerabilities in smart contracts found by literature research and analysis. It compares currently available code analysis tools for their capabilities to identify and detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts based on a taxonomy for vulnerabilities. Finally, based on the TheDOA attack the paper shows an example for the adoption of best practices to avoid severe vulnerabilities in smart contracts.</td>

      <td>On the Security and Performance of Proof of Work Blockchains</td>
      <td>Proof of Work (PoW) powered blockchains currently account for more than 90% of the total market capitalization of existing digital cryptocurrencies. Although the security provisions of Bitcoin have been thoroughly analysed, the security guarantees of variant (forked) PoW blockchains (which were instantiated with different parameters) have not received much attention in the literature. This opens the question whether existing security analysis of Bitcoin's PoW applies to other implementations which have been instantiated with different consensus and/or network parameters.In this paper, we introduce a novel quantitative framework to analyse the security and performance implications of various consensus and network parameters of PoW blockchains. Based on our framework, we devise optimal adversarial strategies for double-spending and selfish mining while taking into account real world constraints such as network propagation, different block sizes, block generation intervals, information propagation mechanism, and the impact of eclipse attacks. Our framework therefore allows us to capture existing PoW-based deployments as well as PoW blockchain variants that are instantiated with different parameters, and to objectively compare the tradeoffs between their performance and security provisions.</td>

      <td>Blockchain technology is a crypto-based secure ledger for data storage and transfer through decentralized, trustless peer-to-peer systems. Despite its advantages, previous studies have shown that the technology is not completely secure against cyber attacks. Thus, it is crucial to perform domain specific risk analysis to measure how viable the attacks are on the system, their impact and consequently the risk exposure. Specifically, in this paper, we carry out an analysis in terms of quantifying the risk associated to an operational multi-layered Blockchain framework for Smart Mobility Data-markets (BSMD). We conduct an actor-based analysis to determine the impact of the attacks. The analysis identified five attack goals and five types of attackers that violate the security of the blockchain system. In the case study of the public-permissioned BSMD, we highlight the highest risk factors according to their impact on the victims in terms of monetary, privacy, integrity and trust. Four attack goals represent a risk in terms of economic losses and one attack goal contains many threats that represent a risk that is either unacceptable or undesirable.</td>

      <td>EOSIO has become one of the most popular blockchain platforms since its mainnet launch in June 2018. In contrast to the traditional PoW-based systems (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum), which are limited by low throughput, EOSIO is the first high throughput Delegated Proof of Stake system that has been widely adopted by many decentralized applications. Although EOSIO has millions of accounts and billions of transactions, little is known about its ecosystem, especially related to security and fraud. In this paper, we perform a large-scale measurement study of the EOSIO blockchain and its associated DApps. We gather a large-scale dataset of EOSIO and characterize activities including money transfers, account creation and contract invocation. Using our insights, we then develop techniques to automatically detect bots and fraudulent activity. We discover thousands of bot accounts (over 30% of the accounts in the platform) and a number of real-world attacks (301 attack accounts). By the time of our study, 80 attack accounts we identified have been confirmed by DApp teams, causing 828,824 EOS tokens losses (roughly \$2.6 million) in total.</td>

The sheer quantity of ads makes manual exploration and analysis unscalable. In addition, discerning whether an ad is advertising a trafficked victim or an independent sex worker is a very difficult task. Very little concrete ground truth (i.e., ads definitively known to be posted by a trafficker) exists in this space. In this work, we develop tools and techniques that can be used separately and in conjunction to group sex ads by their true owner (and not the claimed author in the ad). Specifically, we develop a machine learning classifier that uses stylometry to distinguish between ads posted by the same vs. different authors with 90% TPR and 1% FPR. We also design a linking technique that takes advantage of leakages from the Bitcoin mempool, blockchain and sex ad site, to link a subset of sex ads to Bitcoin public wallets and transactions. Finally, we demonstrate via a 4-week proof of concept using Backpage as the sex ad site, how an analyst can use these automated approaches to potentially find human traffickers.</td>

      <td>Proof-of-stake at stake: predatory, destructive attack on PoS cryptocurrencies</td>
      <td>There have been several 51% attacks on Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains recently, including Verge and GameCredits, but the most noteworthy has been the attack that saw hackers make off with up to $18 million after a successful double-spend was executed on the Bitcoin Gold network. For this reason, the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm, which already has advantages of energy efficiency and throughput, is attracting attention as an alternative to the PoW algorithm. With a PoS, the attacker needs to obtain 51% of the cryptocurrency to carry out a 51% attack. But unlike PoW, the attacker in a PoS system is highly discouraged from launching a 51% attack because he would have to risk losing his entire stake amount to do so. Moreover, even if a 51% attack succeeds, the value of PoS-based cryptocurrency will fall, and the attacker with the most stake will eventually lose the most. In this paper, we propose a predatory, destructive attack on PoS cryptocurrencies. The attacker destroys the PoS cryptocurrency system. Then, using the significant depreciation of cryptocurrency, our method can make a profit from a 51% attack on the PoS cryptocurrencies using the traditional stock market's short selling (or shorting) concept. Our findings are an example to show that the conventional myth that "a destructive attack that destroys the blockchain ecosystem totally will not occur because it is fundamentally unprofitable to the attacker itself" may be wrong.</td>

The application of IoT has evolved from home appliances in the smart home environment such as smart tv, smart refrigerator, smart door and has grown into smart building, smart city, smart healthcare, smart industry. We could imagine that everything could go online to cut cost, add value to businesses and increase users convenience.

      <td>Misbehavior in Bitcoin: A Study of Double-Spending and Accountability</td>
      <td>Bitcoin is a decentralized payment system that relies on Proof-of-Work (PoW) to resist double-spending through a distributed timestamping service. To ensure the operation and security of Bitcoin, it is essential that all transactions and their order of execution are available to all Bitcoin users.Unavoidably, in such a setting, the security of transactions comes at odds with transaction privacy. Motivated by the fact that transaction confirmation in Bitcoin requires tens of minutes, we analyze the conditions for performing successful double-spending attacks against fast payments in Bitcoin, where the time between the exchange of currency and goods is short (in the order of a minute). We show that unless new detection techniques are integrated in the Bitcoin implementation, double-spending attacks on fast payments succeed with considerable probability and can be mounted at low cost. We propose a new and lightweight countermeasure that enables the detection of double-spending attacks in fast transactions.In light of such misbehavior, accountability becomes crucial. We show that in the specific case of Bitcoin, accountability complements privacy. To illustrate this tension, we provide accountability and privacy definition for Bitcoin, and we investigate analytically and empirically the privacy and accountability provisions in Bitcoin.</td>

There exist many software libraries supporting various programming languages that allow access to the Bitcoin system via an Application Programming Interface (API). APIs that are inappropriately used would lead to bugs and security vulnerabilities, which are hard to discover resulting in serious zero-day attacks. Making APIs usable is, therefore, an essential aspect related to the quality and robustness of software. This paper surveys the general academic literature concerning API usability and usable security. Furthermore, it evaluates the API usability of libbitcoin, a well-known C++ implementation of the bitcoin system, and assesses how the findings of this evaluation could affect the applications that use libbitcoin. In addition, the paper proposes two static analysis tools for such a purpose. The findings of this research have improved libbitcoin in many places as will be shown in the paper.</td>

      <td>Sybil-Resistant Mixing for Bitcoin</td>
      <td>A fundamental limitation of Bitcoin and its variants is that the movement of coin between addresses can be observed by examining the public block chain. This record enables adversaries to link addresses to individuals, and to identify multiple addresses as belonging to a single participant. Users can try to hide this information by mixing, where a participant exchanges the funds in an address coin-for-coin with another participant and address. In this paper, we describe the weaknesses of extant mixing protocols, and analyze their vulnerability to Sybil-based denial-of-service and inference attacks. As a solution, we propose Xim, a two-party mixing protocol that is compatible with Bitcoin and related virtual currencies. It is the first decentralized protocol to simultaneously address Sybil attackers, denial-of-service attacks, and timing-based inference attacks. Xim is a multi-round protocol with tunably high success rates. It includes a decentralized system for anonymously finding mix partners based on ads placed in the block chain. No outside party can confirm or find evidence of participants that pair up. We show that Xim's design increases attacker costs linearly with the total number of participants, and that its probabilistic approach to mixing mitigates Sybil-based denial-of-service attack effects. We evaluate protocol delays based on our measurements of the Bitcoin network.</td>

      <td>Static Analysis of Integer Overflow of Smart Contracts in Ethereum</td>
      <td>In recent years, vulnerabilities of smart contracts have frequently break out. In particular, integer overflow of smart contracts, a high-risk vulnerability, has caused huge financial losses. However, most tools currently fail to detect integer overflow in smart contracts. In this paper, we summarize 11 types of integer overflow features for Solidity smart contracts in Ethereum and abstractly define 83 corresponding XPath patterns. And we design an extensible static analysis tool to detect common integer overflow vulnerabilities of Solidity smart contracts in Ethereum through the defined XPath patterns. To evaluate our tool, we tested 7,000 verified Solidity smart contracts and found that there were 430 smart contracts with vulnerabilities of integer overflow. Experimental results show that there are still high-risk vulnerabilities of integer overflow in verified smart contracts.</td>

      <td>ÆGIS: Shielding Vulnerable Smart Contracts Against Attacks</td>
      <td>In recent years, smart contracts have suffered major exploits, cost- ing millions of dollars. Unlike traditional programs, smart contracts are deployed on a blockchain. As such, they cannot be modified once deployed. Though various tools have been proposed to detect vulnerable smart contracts, the majority fails to protect vulnera- ble contracts that have already been deployed on the blockchain. Only very few solutions have been proposed so far to tackle the issue of post-deployment. However, these solutions suffer from low precision and are not generic enough to prevent any type of attack. In this work, we introduce ÆGIS, a dynamic analysis tool that protects smart contracts from being exploited during runtime. Its capability of detecting new vulnerabilities can easily be extended through so-called attack patterns. These patterns are written in a domain-specific language that is tailored to the execution model of Ethereum smart contracts. The language enables the description of malicious control and data flows. In addition, we propose a novel mechanism to streamline and speed up the process of managing attack patterns. Patterns are voted upon and stored via a smart contract, thus leveraging the benefits of tamper-resistance and transparency provided by the blockchain. We compare ÆGIS to current state-of-the-art tools and demonstrate that our solution achieves higher precision in detecting attacks. Finally, we perform a large-scale analysis on the first 4.5 million blocks of the Ethereum blockchain, thereby confirming the occurrences of well reported and yet unreported attacks in the wild.</td>

      <td>A Better Method to Analyze Blockchain Consistency</td>
      <td>The celebrated Nakamoto consensus protocol [16] ushered in several new consensus applications including cryptocurrencies. A few recent works [7, 17] have analyzed important properties of blockchains, including most significantly, consistency, which is a guarantee that all honest parties output the same sequence of blocks throughout the execution of the protocol. To establish consistency, the prior analysis of Pass, Seeman and Shelat [17] required a careful counting of certain combinatorial events that was difficult to apply to variations of Nakamoto. The work of Garay, Kiayas, and Leonardas [7] provides another method of analyzing the blockchain under the simplifying assumption that the network was synchronous. The contribution of this paper is the development of a simple Markov-chain based method for analyzing consistency properties of blockchain protocols. The method includes a formal way of stating strong concentration bounds as well as easy ways to concretely compute the bounds. We use our new method to answer a number of basic questions about consistency of blockchains: Our new analysis provides a tighter guarantee on the consistency property of Nakamoto's protocol, including for parameter regimes which [17] could not consider; We analyze a family of delaying attacks first presented in [17], and extend them to other protocols; We analyze how long a participant should wait before considering a high-value transaction "confirmed"; We analyze the consistency of CliqueChain, a variation of the Chainweb [14] system; We provide the first rigorous consistency analysis of GHOST [20] and also analyze a folklore "balancing"-attack. In each case, we use our framework to experimentally analyze the consensus bounds for various network delay parameters and adversarial computing percentages. We hope our techniques enable authors of future blockchain proposals to provide a more rigorous analysis of their schemes.</td>

      <td>Anonymity and Privacy in Bitcoin Escrow Trades</td>
      <td>As a decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has been in market for around a decade. Bitcoin transactions are thought to be pseudo-anonymous, however, there were many attempts to deanonymize these transactions making use of public data. Escrow services have been introduced as a good private and secure way to handle Bitcoin payments between untrusted parties, where the escrow service acts as the arbitrator in case of disputes. In our work, we examine the privacy and anonymity level of trades done through one of the Bitcoin trading websites offering such escrow services and how using the data they provide for open access through their APIs along with some public scraped data can compromise the privacy and anonymity of trades in some cases. In this paper, we suggest some heuristics and methods to deanonymize Bitcoin escrow trades done on LocalBitcoins.com, a well-known escrow service used especially by people seeking anonymity, and link them to suspect sets of Bitcoin transactions in the blockchain and suspect sets of users. Our research spots privacy weakness points of using escrow services that affects the privacy and anonymity of their users trades and identities. It also shows how tracking down criminals activities across escrow services is possible even without any authority on the escrow service making it less attractive for criminals to use cryptocurrencies and leading it to gain more trust.</td>

      <td>Fractional Reservation Based Mempool Processing in Blockchains</td>
      <td>A massive traffic events that impact all the nodes in the distributed system may cause a Denial of Service (DoS). Managing DoS attacks is even harder in peer-to-peer projects because of multiple equal in rights nodes (miners or maintainers) that communicate across the globe to secure the network. In most blockchains, users can send transactions. Moreover, as a systems throughput is limited, the ability to send transactions should be limited in some honest and transparent way. Otherwise, the pool of unconfirmed (pending) transactions mempool could be overloaded, and it may cause DoS. In Bitcoin, users pay a fee for each transaction to address this issue. Steem.io introduced an alternative approach based on the fractional reservation of the blockchain block space. This approach is an adaptation of similar ones from the network routing and banking systems. The block space fractional reservation for blockchains in terms of a score function is introduced in this paper. Authors made a private blockchain project demo on Exonum framework. The score function influences only on mempool processing, and other blockchains can also make use of it.</td>

      <td>Double-spend Attack Models with Time Advantange for Bitcoin</td>
      <td>Bitcoin is a digital currency in which the need for a trusted third party is avoided. Instead, this digital currency is based on the concept of 'proof of work' allowing users to execute payments by digitally signing their transactions. Since electronic files can be duplicated, fraudulent transactions in the form of double-spend attacks - where users spend the same money at least twice - can happen. This paper is about attack models that can assign possible time advantage to attacker agents in the Bitcoin network. In particular, this paper presents: (i) two attack models in which partial advancement towards block production can be influenced by time and not only by the hashpower used to produce blocks of hashes, and (ii) algorithmic experimentation comparing these models against existing well-known hashrate-based attack models that do not consider time advantage. As a conclusion, this paper presents evidence on the fact that advantages are not negligible for cases in which an attacker has had enough time for secretly mining fraudulent blocks or significant control over the network. Also, the models presented in this paper help in supporting previous claims in the literature about how to correctly model and detect double-spend attacks in the Bitcoin network.</td>

      <td>Research on the Security Criteria of Hash Functions in the Blockchain</td>
      <td>The blockchain is an emerging technology. Because of its efficiency and functionality, it is widely considered to have revolutionary application prospects. As a supporting part of the data structure, the hash function is important for ensuring the availability and security of the blockchain. To evaluate the security of blockchain technology it is important to analyze several security criteria of the hash functions used in the blockchain. This paper focuses on two security criteria-hiding and puzzle-friendliness-that the hash function should satisfy in the blockchain proposed by Narayanan et al. (Narayanan A, Bonneau J, Felten E, et al. Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies: A Comprehensive Introduction. Princeton University Press, 2016). Under the framework of Rogaway?Shrimpton's theory, their definitions are mathematically described and their relation is proved. Also, comparisons between the two criteria and traditional ones in hash functions are made. The conclusions of this paper point out that for hash functions, it is harder to break hiding and puzzle-friendliness than to break preimage resistance, which shows that hash functions proven to be preimage-resistant or tested by preimage cryptanalysis like SHA256 tend to be enough to be used in the corresponding parts of the blockchain design. At the same time, from the attackers' view the conclusions can provide a theoretical basis for studying the potential attacks on and defects that may exist in the structure of the hash functions applied in the blockchain.</td>

      <td>In recent years we have seen a great deal of attention to the topic of security analysis in smart contracts, especially those developed for the Ethereum blockchain. As a result, there seems to be an evergrowing demand for secure smart contracts to protect what could potentially be worth billions. In this paper, we introduce Etherolic as a robust, scalable and efficient fuzzing tool based on concolic testing for performing security analysis on smart contracts. Our approach works based on a successful combination of dynamic taint tracking (DTA) and concolic testing that allows users to analyze the bytecode of smart contracts being run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Moreover, Etherolic is not only able to identify a wide spectrum of recent vulnerabilities in smart contracts, but also it generates exploits to trigger unknown errors in the code. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, we evaluated Etherolic on a crafted benchmark suite, comprising several real-world and synthetic smart contracts along with 98 safety features. The result of our preliminary evaluation reveals 204 security violations in the benchmarks.</td>

      <td>Uniform Randomization for Block Double Validation</td>
      <td>TomoChain1 is a blockchain based on Ethereum framework with the following advantages points: low transaction fee, fast confirmation time, double validation and randomization for security guarantees. In our previous technical white paper, we proposed Proof-of-Stake Voting (PoSV) consensus protocol, a Proof-of-Stake (PoS)-based blockchain protocol with a fair voting mechanism, rigorous security guarantees and fast finality. One of the key parts of PoSV is the double validation process, which requires randomization to generate the list of block verifiers (with uniform distribution and unpredictability) for each epoch. In other words, randomization of block verifiers in double validation is the key factor of reducing risks coming from paired hand-shaking attackers trying to commit malicious blocks.In this paper, we focus on studying methods for randomization of block verifiers. In particular, we study combinatorial and probability theory, and then apply the fixed-point-free permutation method for randomization. With this approach, we show that the contributions and benefits of verifiers are fair in the sense that the probability distribution function is uniform eventually. Finally, we implement the proposed protocol and conduct experiments on TomoChain public blockchain.</td>

      <td>On the Strategy and Behavior of Bitcoin Mining with N-attackers</td>
      <td>Selfish mining is a well-known mining attack strategy discovered by Eyal and Sirer in 2014. After that, the attackers' strategy has been further discussed by many other works, which analyze the strategy and behavior of a single attacker. The extension of the strategy research is greatly restricted by the assumption that there is only one attacker in the blockchain network, since, in many cases, a proof of work blockchain has multiple attackers. The attackers can be independent of others instead of sharing information and attacking the blockchain as a whole. In this paper, we will establish a new model to analyze the miners' behavior in a proof of work blockchain with multiple attackers. Based on our model, we extend the attackers' strategy by proposing a new strategy set publish-n. Meanwhile, we will also review other attacking strategies such as selfish mining and stubborn mining in our model to explore whether these strategies work or not when there are multiple attackers. The performances of different strategies are compared using relative stale block rate of the attackers. In a proof of work blockchain model with two attackers, strategy publish-n can beat selfish mining by up to 26.3%.</td>

      <td>Ethereum, one of the most popular blockchain platforms, provides financial transactions like payments and auctions through smart contracts. Due to the immense interest in smart contracts in academia, the research community of smart contract security has made a significant improvement recently. Researchers have reported various security vulnerabilities in smart contracts, and developed static analysis tools and verification frameworks to detect them. However, it is unclear whether such great efforts from academia has indeed enhanced the security of smart contracts in reality.To understand the security level of smart contracts in the wild, we empirically studied 55,046 real-world Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity, the most popular programming language used by Ethereum smart contract developers. We first examined how many well-known vulnerabilities the Solidity compiler has patched, and how frequently the Solidity team publishes compiler releases. Unfortunately, we observed that many known vulnerabilities are not yet patched, and some patches are not even sufficient to avoid their target vulnerabilities. Subsequently, we investigated whether smart contract developers use the most recent compiler with vulnerabilities patched. We reported that developers of more than 98% of real-world Solidity contracts still use older compilers without vulnerability patches, and more than 25% of the contracts are potentially vulnerable due to the missing security patches. To understand actual impacts of the missing patches, we manually investigated potentially vulnerable contracts that are detected by our static analyzer and identified common mistakes by Solidity developers, which may cause serious security issues such as financial loss. We detected hundreds of vulnerable contracts and about one fourth of the vulnerable contracts are used by thousands of people. We recommend the Solidity team to make patches that resolve known vulnerabilities correctly, and developers to use the latest Solidity compiler to avoid missing security patches.</td>

      <td>Notary: a device for secure transaction approval</td>
      <td>Notary is a new hardware and software architecture for running isolated approval agents in the form factor of a USB stick with a small display and buttons. Approval agents allow factoring out critical security decisions, such as getting the user's approval to sign a Bitcoin transaction or to delete a backup, to a secure environment. The key challenge addressed by Notary is to securely switch between agents on the same device. Prior systems either avoid the problem by building single-function devices like a USB U2F key, or they provide weak isolation that is susceptible to kernel bugs, side channels, or Rowhammer-like attacks. Notary achieves strong isolation using reset-based switching, along with the use of physically separate systems-on-a-chip for agent code and for the kernel, and a machine-checked proof of both the hardware's register-transfer-level design and software, showing that reset-based switching leaks no state. Notary also provides a trustworthy I/O path between the agent code and the user, which prevents an adversary from tampering with the user's screen or buttons.We built a hardware/software prototype of Notary, using a combination of ARM and RISC-V processors. The prototype demonstrates that it is feasible to verify Notary's reset-based switching, and that Notary can support diverse agents, including cryptocurrencies and a transaction approval agent for traditional client-server applications such as websites. Measurements of reset-based switching show that it is fast enough for interactive use. We analyze security bugs in existing cryptocurrency hardware wallets, which aim to provide a similar form factor and feature set as Notary, and show that Notary's design avoids many bugs that affect them.</td>

      <td>We introduce FairSwap -- an efficient protocol for fair exchange of digital goods using smart contracts. A fair exchange protocol allows a sender S to sell a digital commodity x for a fixed price p to a receiver R. The protocol is said to be secure if R only pays if he receives the correct x. Our solution guarantees fairness by relying on smart contracts executed over decentralized cryptocurrencies, where the contract takes the role of an external judge that completes the exchange in case of disagreement. While in the past there have been several proposals for building fair exchange protocols over cryptocurrencies, our solution has two distinctive features that makes it particular attractive when users deal with large commodities. These advantages are: (1) minimizing the cost for running the smart contract on the blockchain, and (2) avoiding expensive cryptographic tools such as zero-knowledge proofs. In addition to our new protocols, we provide formal security definitions for smart contract based fair exchange, and prove security of our construction. Finally, we illustrate several applications of our basic protocol and evaluate practicality of our approach via a prototype implementation for fairly selling large files over the cryptocurrency Ethereum.</td>

      <td>Bitcoin seems to be the most successful cryptocurrency so far given the growing real life deployment and popularity. While Bitcoin requires clients to be online to perform transactions and a certain amount of time to verify them, there are many real life scenarios that demand for offline and immediate payments (e.g., mobile ticketing, vending machines, etc). However, offline payments in Bitcoin raise non-trivial security challenges, as the payee has no means to verify the received coins without having access to the Bitcoin network. Moreover, even online immediate payments are shown to be vulnerable to double-spending attacks. In this paper, we propose the first solution for Bitcoin payments, which enables secure payments with Bitcoin in offline settings and in scenarios where payments need to be immediately accepted. Our approach relies on an offline wallet and deploys several novel security mechanisms to prevent double-spending and to verify the coin validity in offline setting. These mechanisms achieve probabilistic security to guarantee that the attack probability is lower than the desired threshold. We provide a security and risk analysis as well as model security parameters for various adversaries. We further eliminate remaining risks by detection of misbehaving wallets and their revocation.We implemented our solution for mobile Android clients and instantiated an offline wallet using a microSD security card. Our implementation demonstrates that smooth integration over a very prevalent platform (Android) is possible, and that offline and online payments can practically co-exist. We also discuss alternative deployment approach for the offline wallet which does not leverage secure hardware, but instead relies on a deposit system managed by the Bitcoin network.</td>

Fraudsters are sometimes to blame, but not always. Twenty-five exchanges suffered security breaches, 15 of which subsequently closed. We present logistic regressions using longitudinal data on Bitcoin exchanges aggregated quarterly. We find that experiencing a breach is correlated with a 13 times greater odds that an exchange will close in that same quarter. We find that higher-volume exchanges are less likely to close (each doubling in trade volume corresponds to a 12% decrease in the odds of closure). We also find that exchanges that derive most of their business from trading less popular (fiat) currencies, which are offered by at most one competitor, are less likely to close.</td>

For each of these tasks we propose a formal model and design protocols satisfying our model's constraints in a hybrid model where parties have access to special ideal functionalities that enable monetary transactions. We summarize our results: Verifiable computation. We consider a setting where a delegator outsources computation to a worker who expects to get paid in return for delivering correct outputs. We design protocols that compile both public and private verification schemes to support incentivizations described above.Secure computation with restricted leakage. Building on the recent work of Huang et al. (Security and Privacy 2012), we show an efficient secure computation protocol that monetarily penalizes an adversary that attempts to learn one bit of information but gets detected in the process. Fair secure computation. Inspired by recent work, we consider a model of secure computation where a party that aborts after learning the output is monetarily penalized. We then propose an ideal transaction functionality FML and show a constant-round realization on the Bitcoin network. Then, in the FML-hybrid world we design a constant round protocol for secure computation in this model. Noninteractive bounties. We provide formal definitions and candidate realizations of noninteractive bounty mechanisms on the Bitcoin network which (1) allow a bounty maker to place a bounty for the solution of a hard problem by sending a single message, and (2) allow a bounty collector (unknown at the time of bounty creation) with the solution to claim the bounty, while (3) ensuring that the bounty maker can learn the solution whenever its bounty is collected, and (4) preventing malicious eavesdropping parties from both claiming the bounty as well as learning the solution.All our protocol realizations (except those realizing fair secure computation) rely on a special ideal functionality that is not currently supported in Bitcoin due to limitations imposed on Bitcoin scripts. Motivated by this, we propose validation complexity of a protocol, a formal complexity measure that captures the amount of computational effort required to validate Bitcoin transactions required to implement it in Bitcoin. Our protocols are also designed to take advantage of optimistic scenarios where participating parties behave honestly.</td>

Both attacks can increase the reward of attackers. Furthermore, we show PAW can avoid the "miner's dilemma" in BWH attacks. BSM introduces a new "venal miner's dilemma", which results in all targets (bribes) willing to help the attacker but getting less reward finally.

      <td>Rational Manager in Bitcoin Mining Pool: Dynamic Strategies to Gain Extra Rewards</td>
      <td>Participants of the Bitcoin system form mining pools, which have become the leading institutions of the Bitcoin mining economy, to smooth their reward of mining. Many attacks towards mining pools have been proposed. Block Withholding attack is an attacker splitting some of the power to mine in a pool, submitting shares while withholding blocks, which is one of the most famous and original attacks. Few pieces of research pay attention to the case that managers work rationally to gain extra rewards themselves at the same time of countering withholding attack. However, some different reward functions have been proposed to avoid rational miners' withholding. In this paper, we offer a model that a rational manager gain extra rewards and incentivize miners not to withhold blocks by applying a dynamic mining strategy. We conduct quantitive analysis and simulations to verify the availability and effectiveness of our attacks. We show the attack benefits the miners in the pool in some circumstances, and further discuss improvement for our attack.</td>

      <td>How to Use Bitcoin to Play Decentralized Poker</td>
      <td>Back and Bentov (arXiv 2014) and Andrychowicz et al. (Security and Privacy 2014) introduced techniques to perform secure multiparty computations on Bitcoin. Among other things, these works constructed lottery protocols that ensure that any party that aborts after learning the outcome pays a monetary penalty to all other parties. Following this, Andrychowicz et al. (Bitcoin Workshop 2014) and concurrently Bentov and Kumaresan (Crypto 2014) extended the solution to arbitrary secure function evaluation while guaranteeing fairness in the following sense: any party that aborts after learning the output pays a monetary penalty to all parties that did not learn the output. Andrychowicz et al. (Bitcoin Workshop 2014) also suggested extending to scenarios where parties receive a payoff according to the output of a secure function evaluation, and outlined a 2-party protocol for the same that in addition satisfies the notion of fairness described above. In this work, we formalize, generalize, and construct multiparty protocols for the primitive suggested by Andrychowicz et al. We call this primitive secure cash distribution with penalties. Our formulation of secure cash distribution with penalties poses it as a multistage reactive functionality (i.e., more general than secure function evaluation) that provides a way to securely implement smart contracts in a decentralized setting, and consequently suffices to capture a wide variety of stateful computations involving data and/or money, such as decentralized auctions, market, and games such as poker, etc. Our protocol realizing secure cash distribution with penalties works in a hybrid model where parties have access to a claim-or-refund transaction functionality FCR}* which can be efficiently realized in (a variant of) Bitcoin, and is otherwise independent of the Bitcoin ecosystem. We emphasize that our protocol is dropout-tolerant in the sense that any party that drops out during the protocol is forced to pay a monetary penalty to all other parties. Our formalization and construction generalize both secure computation with penalties of Bentov and Kumaresan (Crypto 2014), and secure lottery with penalties of Andrychowicz et al. (Security and Privacy 2014).</td>

      <td>An Auditable and Secure Model for Permissioned Blockchain</td>
      <td>The intrinsic tamper-resistant characteristic of blockchain enables transaction to be permanently stored as immutable record, which provides extremely reliable information traceability for some application scenarios such as supply chain and copyright protection. However, in fact, even the Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithm cannot fundamentally guarantee that transaction information is real and legitimate in reality. Therefore, the normal operation of the blockchain system requires the establishment of a special supervisory body to audit the transaction information, which can ensure that the data sources are credible rather than spurious or illegal. In addition, in the environment of permissioned blockchain, the realization of access mechanism often relies on centralized certificate authority. Unfortunately, a highly centralized management entity is not entirely trustworthy and reliable because it may be corrupt or attacked, which inevitably triggers many information security incidents such as privacy leakage and data loss. In order to realize the secure governance of permissioned blockchain system, a novel multi-supervised permissioned blockchain (MSPB) model is proposed in this paper, which supports auditing and eliminates the centralized entities in the system, including certification authority and auditing authority. We evaluated the security and performance of the proposed model to demonstrate its feasibility, reliability and effectiveness.</td>

      <td>A case for the economics of secure software development</td>
      <td>Over the past 15 years the topic of information security economics has grown to become a large and diverse field, influencing security thinking on issues as diverse as bitcoin markets and cybersecurity insurance. An aspect yet to receive much attention in this respect is that of secure software development, or 'SWSec' --- another area that has seen a surge of research since 2000. SWSec provides paradigms, practices and procedures that offer some promise to address current security problems, yet those solutions face financial and technical barriers that necessitate a more thorough approach to planning and execution. Meanwhile, information security economics has developed theory and practice to support a particular world-view; however, it has yet to account for the investments, constructs and benefits of SWSec. As the frequency and severity of computer misuse has increased, both areas have struggled to impart a new mindset for addressing the inherent issues that arise in a diverse, connected and functionality-driven landscape.This paper presents a call for the establishment of an economics of secure software development. We present the primary challenges facing practice, citing relevant literature from both communities to illustrate where commonalities lie --- and where further work is needed. Those challenges are decomposed into a research agenda, deriving from the application of principles in both themes a lack of models, representation and analysis in practice. A framework emerges that facilitates discussions of security theory and practice.</td>

Checkpointing is referred as solution to mitigate the impact of the long range attack but still for the newly joined users as well as the users those will stay offline for long period of time, checkpointing mechanism needs to be re-evaluated.

      <td>Permissionless blockchains allow the execution of arbitrary programs (called smart contracts), enabling mutually untrusted entities to interact without relying on trusted third parties. Despite their potential, repeated security concerns have shaken the trust in handling billions of USD by smart contracts. To address this problem, we present Securify, a security analyzer for Ethereum smart contracts that is scalable, fully automated, and able to prove contract behaviors as safe/unsafe with respect to a given property. Securify's analysis consists of two steps. First, it symbolically analyzes the contract's dependency graph to extract precise semantic information from the code. Then, it checks compliance and violation patterns that capture sufficient conditions for proving if a property holds or not. To enable extensibility, all patterns are specified in a designated domain-specific language. Securify is publicly released, it has analyzed &gt;18K contracts submitted by its users, and is regularly used to conduct security audits by experts. We present an extensive evaluation of Securify over real-world Ethereum smart contracts and demonstrate that it can effectively prove the correctness of smart contracts and discover critical violations.</td>

In this work, we introduce Æ GIS, a tool that shields smart contracts and users on the blockchain from being exploited. To this end, ÆGIS reverts transactions in real-time based on pattern matching. These patterns encode the detection of malicious transactions that trigger exploits or scams. New patterns are voted upon and stored via a smart contract, thus leveraging the benefits of tamper-resistance and transparency provided by blockchain. By allowing its protection to be updated, the smart contract acts as a smart shield.</td>

      <td>Be Selfish and Avoid Dilemmas: Fork After Withholding (FAW) Attacks on Bitcoin</td>
      <td>In the Bitcoin system, participants are rewarded for solving cryptographic puzzles. In order to receive more consistent rewards over time, some participants organize mining pools and split the rewards from the pool in proportion to each participant's contribution. However, several attacks threaten the ability to participate in pools. The block withholding (BWH) attack makes the pool reward system unfair by letting malicious participants receive unearned wages while only pretending to contribute work. When two pools launch BWH attacks against each other, they encounter the miner's dilemma: in a Nash equilibrium, the revenue of both pools is diminished. In another attack called selfish mining, an attacker can unfairly earn extra rewards by deliberately generating forks.In this paper, we propose a novel attack called a fork after withholding (FAW) attack. FAW is not just another attack. The reward for an FAW attacker is always equal to or greater than that for a BWH attacker, and it is usable up to four times more often per pool than in BWH attack. When considering multiple pools --- the current state of the Bitcoin network -- the extra reward for an FAW attack is about 56% more than that for a BWH attack. Furthermore, when two pools execute FAW attacks on each other, the miner's dilemma may not hold: under certain circumstances, the larger pool can consistently win. More importantly, an FAW attack, while using intentional forks, does not suffer from practicality issues, unlike selfish mining. We also discuss partial countermeasures against the FAW attack, but finding a cheap and efficient countermeasure remains an open problem. As a result, we expect to see FAW attacks among mining pools.</td>

      <td>The blockchain is a decentralized distributed accounting system. With the development of the blockchain technology and its wide application, the core of the decentralization-consensus algorithm has attracted the attention of researchers. However, the previous POW mining consensus algorithm is a low-efficiency and high-cost consensus mechanism. In this paper, we propose an MPC-DPOS election consensus algorithm, which is improved by integrating the logic ring-based election algorithm and the Yao's millionaire algorithm into the basic DPOS algorithm to address secure multi-party computation problem. Specifically, the MPC-DPOS algorithm first selects the 101 candidate nodes from the many nodes of the blockchain system into a logical ring in the first stage, which will participate in the next election process of the proxy nodes to generate new blocks. In addition, since the weights are compared while the shares are not known, Yao's millionaire algorithm is added in the second election process, and the agent nodes are selected to generate new blocks finally. Extensive experiments show that the proposed MPC-DPOS election consensus algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance with the respect to safety and adaptability to meet the high efficiency and low-cost requirements of commercial applications.</td>

In this paper, we investigate a novel, TTP-independent approach towards sybil-resistant PPC.

      <td>Market-based Security for Distributed Applications</td>
      <td>Ethereum contracts can be designed to function as fully decentralized applications called DAPPs that hold financial assets, and many have already been fielded. Unfortunately, DAPPs can be hacked, and the assets they control can be stolen. A recent attack on an Ethereum decentralized application called The DAO demonstrated that smart contract bugs are more than an academic concern. Ether worth hundreds of millions of US dollars was extracted by an attacker from The DAO, sending the value of its tokens and the overall exchange price of ether itself tumbling.We present two market-based techniques for insuring the ether holdings of a DAPP. These mechanisms exist and are managed as part of the core programming of the DAPP, rather than as separate mechanisms managed by users. Our first technique is based on futures contracts indexed by the trade price of ether for DAPP tokens. Under fairly general circumstances, our technique is capable of recovering the majority of ether lost from theft with high probability even when all of the ether holdings are stolen; and the only cost to DAPP token holders is an adjustable ether withdrawal fee. As a second, complementary, technique we propose the use of Gated Public Offerings (GPO) as a mechanism that mitigates the effects of attackers that exploit DAPP withdrawal vulnerabilities. We show that using more than one public offering round encourages attackers to exploit the vulnerability early, or depending on certain factors, to delay exploitation (possibly indefinitely) and short tokens in the market instead. In both cases, less ether is ultimately stolen from the DAPP, and in the later case, some of the losses are transferred to the market.</td>

To this end, STEP randomly selects nodes to create blocks, divides the validation process into two stages, and provides a reward for rapid and correct validation.

Existing studies on pools' interactive attacks usually employ the conventional game theory, where the strategies of the players are considered pure and equal, neglecting the existence of powerful strategies and the corresponding favorable game results. In this study, we take advantage of the Zero-Determinant (ZD) strategy to analyze the block withholding attack between any two pools, where the ZD adopter has the unilateral control on the expected payoffs of its opponent and itself. In this case, we are faced with the following questions: who can adopt the ZD strategy? individually or simultaneously? what can the ZD player achieve? In order to answer these questions, we derive the conditions under which two pools can individually or simultaneously employ the ZD strategy and demonstrate the effectiveness. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use the ZD strategy to analyze the block withholding attack among pools.</td>

In consequence, it is questioned whether privacy and security can be preserved when collecting educational data. As a result, some policies and good practices are set to frame how student data should be used in the application of this analytical approach. Its objective is to increase confidence in the application of Learning Analytics. However, some of these legal actions, which are limited to the areas in which they are originated, are the result of allegations of data leakage. Hence, these initiatives can do little to insure the use of sensitive data of students in unknown situations. To ensure continuity and an increase of confidence in the application of Learning Analytics is necessary to bind to legality a new approach to safeguard privacy of students' data in its current and future uses. Considering the above, it is possible to add a technological layer above these policies that ensures its viability. Some emerging technologies such as blockchain and smart contracts are strong candidates to ensure privacy and secure sensible data of students. The use of smart contracts allows the automation of legal actions so that they are executed as soon as irregularities in the use or data collection are detected.

However, these third-parties play an important role in securing brokered communications and are essential in providing Authentication and Non-Repudiation according to current models. Clearly, such an approach cannot be used in peer-to-peer networks and there is need for a simple model applicable in fully decentralized networks to provide Non-Repudiation.

      <td>Improvements to Secure Computation with Penalties</td>
      <td>Motivated by the impossibility of achieving fairness in secure computation [Cleve, STOC 1986], recent works study a model of fairness in which an adversarial party that aborts on receiving output is forced to pay a mutually predefined monetary penalty to every other party that did not receive the output. These works show how to design protocols for secure computation with penalties that tolerate an arbitrary number of corruptions.In this work, we improve the efficiency of protocols for secure computation with penalties in a hybrid model where parties have access to the "claim-or-refund" transaction functionality. Our first improvement is for the ladder protocol of Bentov and Kumaresan (Crypto 2014) where we improve the dependence of the script complexity of the protocol (which corresponds to miner verification load and also space on the blockchain) on the number of parties from quadratic to linear (and in particular, is completely independent of the underlying function). Our second improvement is for the see-saw protocol of Kumaresan et al. (CCS 2015) where we reduce the total number of claim-or-refund transactions and also the script complexity from quadratic to linear in the number of parties.We also present a 'dual-mode' protocol that offers different guarantees depending on the number of corrupt parties: (1) when s&lt;n/2 parties are corrupt, this protocol guarantees fairness (i.e., either all parties get the output or none do), and (2) when t &gt; n/2 parties are corrupt, this protocol guarantees fairness with penalties (i.e., if the adversary gets the output, then either the honest parties get output as well or they get compensation via penalizing the adversary). The above protocol works as long as t+s &lt; n, matching the bound obtained for secure computation protocols in the standard model (i.e., replacing "fairness with penalties" with "security-with-abort" (full security except fairness)) by Ishai et al. (SICOMP 2011).</td>

      <td>PQ-Fabric: A Permissioned Blockchain Secure from Both Classical and Quantum Attacks</td>
      <td>Hyperledger Fabric is a prominent and flexible proposal for a permissioned distributed ledger platform. It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows for selecting distinct trust models and performance/throughput trade-offs. On the other hand, access control and identity management intrinsically relies on credentials issued by a Certificate Authority of a Membership Service Provider (MSP). The default MSP implementation, instantiated by the means of the the Blockchain Cryptographic Service Provider interface (BCCSP), only handles standard classical PKI methods for authentication and digital signatures, accommodating basically RSA and ECDSA classical signatures. Also only one single signature scheme is assumed to be employed at a given MSP instantiation. This makes the credential-related functions highly attached to single classical standard primitives. Unfortunately, it is well known that RSA and ECDSA are vulnerable to quantum attacks and an ongoing post-quantum standardization process run by NIST aims to identify quantum-safe drop-in replacements for such cryptographic primitives in a few years. In this paper, we propose a redesign of the credential-management procedures and related specifications in order to incorporate hybrid digital signatures (i.e., protection against both classical and quantum attacks using two signature schemes) that include the quantum-safe signatures from the upcoming NIST standards. We also validate our proposal by providing an implementation of Fabric along with the Open Quantum Safe library. Our implementation employs the crypto-agility concept, which allows for plugging in different algorithms in the MSP Credentials and performing comparative benchmarks with them. Moreover, our proposal is backwards compatible with the client implementations, and no SDK changes would be required for the client Node.JS code.</td>

      <td>Formalizing and Verifying Decentralized Systems with Extended Concurrent Separation Logic</td>
      <td>Decentralized techniques are becoming crucial and ubiquitous with the rapid advancement of distributed ledger technologies such as the blockchain. Numerous decentralized systems have been developed to address security and privacy issues with great dependability and reliability via these techniques. Meanwhile, formalization and verification of the decentralized systems is the key to ensuring correctness of the design and security properties of the implementation. In this paper, we propose a novel method of formalizing and verifying decentralized systems with a kind of extended concurrent separation logic. Our logic extends the standard concurrent separation logic with new features including communication encapsulation, environment perception, and node-level reasoning, which enhances modularity and expressiveness. Besides, we develop our logic with unitarity and compatibility to facilitate implementation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our method by applying our logic to formalize and verify critical techniques in decentralized systems including the consensus mechanism and the smart contract.</td>

      <td>Self-healing Dilemmas in Distributed Systems: Fault-correction vs. Fault-tolerance</td>
      <td>Large-scale decentralized systems of autonomous agents interacting via asynchronous communication often experience the following self-healing dilemma: Fault-detection inherits network uncertainties making a faulty process indistinguishable from a slow process. The implications can be dramatic: Self-healing mechanisms become biased and cost-ineffective. In particular, triggering an undesirable fault-correction results in new faults that could be prevented with fault-tolerance instead. Nevertheless, fault-tolerance alone without eventually correcting persistent faults makes systems underperforming as well. Measuring, understanding and resolving such self-healing dilemmas is a timely challenge and critical requirement given the rise of distributed ledgers, edge computing, the Internet of Things in several application domains of energy, transport and health. This paper introduces a novel and general-purpose modeling of fault scenarios. They can accurately measure and predict inconsistencies generated by fault-correction and fault-tolerance when each node in a network can monitor the health status of another node, while both can defect. In contrast to related work, no information about the computational/application scenario, overlying algorithms or application data is required. A rigorous experimental methodology is designed that evaluates 696 experimental settings of different fault scales, fault profiles and fault detection thresholds, each with almost 9 million measurements of inconsistencies in a prototyped decentralized network of 3000 nodes. The prediction performance of the modeled fault scenarios is validated in a challenging application scenario of decentralized and dynamic in-network aggregation using real-world data from a Smart Grid pilot project. Findings confirm the origin of inconsistencies at design phase and provide new insights how to tune self-healing mechanisms at design phase. Strikingly, the aggregation accuracy is well predicted as shown by high correlations and low root mean square errors when calibration methods with application-independent features are applied.

      <td>In public distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), such as Blockchains, nodes can join and leave the network at any time. A major challenge occurs when a new node joining the network wants to retrieve the current state of the ledger. Indeed, that node may receive conflicting information from honest and Byzantine nodes, making it difficult to identify the current state. In this paper, we are interested in protocols that are stateless, i.e., a new joining node should be able to retrieve the current state of the ledger just using a fixed amount of data that characterizes the ledger (such as the genesis block in Bitcoin). We define three variants of stateless DLTs: weak, strong, and probabilistic. Then, we analyze this property for DLTs using different types of consensus.</td>

In certain applications, it is paramount to be certain that an endpoint actually belong to a specific subject. Currently, when this is needed, endpoints are either verified by who needs it, which is impractical in blockchain-based applications, or by a centralized authority, which contrasts with the spirit of the blockchain.In this paper, we show two layer-two blockchain-based protocols to prove the association between a subject and an endpoint in a decentralized manner. Our protocols are compatible with a wide variety of endpoints and contribute to fill the gap of the current self sovereign IdM approaches with respect to decentralization.

      <td>Smart contracts are the artifact of the blockchain that provide immutable and verifiable specifications of physical transactions. Solidity is a domain-specific programming language with the purpose of defining smart contracts. It aims at reducing the transaction costs occasioned by the execution of contracts on the distributed ledgers such as the Ethereum. However, Solidity contracts need to adhere safety and security requirements that require formal verification and certification. This paper proposes a method to meet such requirements by translating Solidity contracts to Event-B models, supporting certification. To that purpose, we define a restrained Solidity subset and a transfer function which translates Solidity contracts to Event-B models. Then we take advantage of Event-B method capabilities to refine models at different levels of abstraction to verify Solidity contracts' properties. And we can verify the generated proof obligations of the Event-B model with the help of the Rodin platform.</td>

      <td>Parasite Chain Detection in the IOTA Protocol</td>
      <td>In recent years several distributed ledger technologies based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) have appeared on the market. Similar to blockchain technologies, DAG-based systems aim to build an immutable ledger and are faced with security concerns regarding the irreversibility of the ledger state. However, due to their more complex nature and recent popularity, the study of adversarial actions has received little attention so far. In this paper we are concerned with a particular type of attack on the IOTA cryptocurrency, more specifically a Parasite Chain attack that attempts to revert the history stored in the DAG structure, also called the Tangle. \nIn order to improve the security of the Tangle, we present a detection mechanism for this type of attack. In this mechanism, we embrace the complexity of the DAG structure by sampling certain aspects of it, more particularly the distribution of the number of approvers. We initially describe models that predict the distribution that should be expected for a Tangle without any malicious actors. We then introduce metrics that compare this reference distribution with the measured distribution. Upon detection, measures can then be taken to render the attack unsuccessful. We show that due to a form of the Parasite Chain that is different from the main Tangle it is possible to detect certain types of malicious chains. We also show that although the attacker may change the structure of the Parasite Chain to avoid detection, this is done so at a significant cost since the attack is rendered less efficient.</td>

      <td>Traditional public distributed ledgers have not been able to scale-out well and work efficiently. Sharding is deemed as a promising way to solve this problem. By partitioning all nodes into small committees and letting them work in parallel, we can significantly lower the amount of communication and computation, reduce the overhead on each node’s storage, as well as enhance the throughput of the distributed ledger. Existing sharding-based protocols still suffer from several serious drawbacks. The first thing is that all non-faulty nodes must connect well with each other, which demands a huge number of communication channels in the network. Moreover, previous protocols have faced great loss in efficiency in the case where the honesty of each committee’s leader is in question. At the same time, no explicit incentive is provided for nodes to actively participate in the protocol.We present CycLedger, a scalable and secure parallel protocol for distributed ledger via sharding. Our protocol selects a leader and a partial set for each committee, who are in charge of maintaining intra-shard consensus and communicating with other committees, to reduce the amortized complexity of communication, computation, and storage on all nodes. We introduce a novel semi-commitment scheme between committees and a recovery procedure to prevent the system from crashing even when leaders of committees are malicious. To add incentive for the network, we use the concept of reputation, which measures each node’s trusty computing power. As nodes with a higher reputation receive more rewards, there is an encouragement for nodes with strong computing ability to work honestly to gain reputation. In this way, we strike out a new path to establish scalability, security, and incentive for the sharding-based distributed ledger.</td>

      <td>Online voting in the UK generally takes place without verifiability mechanisms, with providers that are trusted to provide ballot privacy and correctness of the result. However, replacing existing systems with verifiable voting systems with brand new algorithms and code presents a business risk to election providers. We present an approach for incremental change: adding a Selene-based verifiability layer to an existing online voting system. Selene is a verifiable e-voting protocol that publishes votes in plaintext alongside tracking numbers that enable voters to confirm that their votes have been captured correctly by the system. This results in a system where even the election authority running the system cannot change the result in an undetectable way. This gives stronger guarantees on the integrity of the election than were previously present. This gives an end-to-end verifiable system we call Verify My Vote (VMV). In addition, we outline how this approach supports further incremental changes towards the deployment of fully trustworthy online voting systems. The paper also describes the use of distributed ledger technology as a component of VMV to manage the verifiability data in a decentralised way for resilience and trust.</td>

Blockchain works over peer-to-peer (P2P) phenomenon for its operation and does not require any trusted-third party authorization for data tracking and storage. The information stored in blockchain is distributed throughout the decentralized network and is usually protected using cryptographic hash functions. Since the beginning of blockchain technology, its use in different applications is increasing exponentially, but this increased use has also raised some questions regarding privacy and security of data being stored in it. Protecting privacy of blockchain data using data perturbation strategy such as differential privacy could be a novel approach to overcome privacy issues in blockchain. In this article, we discuss integration of differential privacy in certain blockchain based scenarios. Moreover, we highlight some future application scenarios in which integration of differential privacy in blockchain can produce fruitful results.</td>

We also consider two options for modification of existing cryptocurrency protocols for dealing with this type of attacks. First, we discuss a modification that requires introducing changes in the Bitcoin protocol and allows diminishing the motivation to attack wallets. Second, an alternative option is the construction of special smart-contracts, which reward the users for providing evidence of the brute-force attack.

      <td>Distributed ledger and blockchain systems are expected to make financial systems easier to audit, reduce counter-party risk and transfer assets seamlessly. The key concept is a token controlled by a cryptographic private key for spending, and represented by a public key for receiving and audit purposes. Ownership transfers are authorized with digital signatures and recorded on a ledger visible to numerous participants. Several ways to enhance the privacy of such ledgers have been proposed. In this paper we study two major techniques to enhance privacy of token transfers with the help of improved cryptography: M\"obius and CryptoNote. The comparison is illuminating: both techniques use "ring signatures" and some form of "stealth addressing" or key derivation techniques, yet each does it in a completely different way. M\"obius is more recent and operates in a more co-operative way (with permission) and is not yet specified at a sufficiently detailed level. Our primary goal is to explore the suitability of these two techniques for improving the privacy of payments on cryptographic ledgers. We explain various conflicting requirements and strategic choices which arise when trying to conceal the identity of participants and the exact details of transactions in our context while simultaneously enabling fast final settlement of tokens with a reasonable level of liquidity. We show that in these systems, third-party observers see obfuscated settlement. We finish with a summary of explicit warnings and advice for implementors of such systems.</td>

Smart contracts permit the implementation of application logic to foster distributed systems that are capable of removing intermediaries. Hereby, lock in effects originating from isolated data storage and central authorities are mitigated. Yet, smart contracts deployed to a ledger generate dependencies on the underlying blockchain. Over time, requirements regarding contract execution may detach from the utilized blockchain due to contradicting incentives and security or performance issues. To avoid a novel form of lock in effect towards a host blockchain, we introduce a concept for smart contract portability that permits any user to migrate contract logic and state between blockchains in a flexible and verifiable manner. As the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is supported by a multitude of blockchain implementations, it poses a common execution environment for smart contracts. We provide a toolbox that facilitates smart contract portability between EVM-compatible blockchains without trust requirements in the entity executing the migration process. To prove the concept’s soundness, we transfer token contracts based on the ERC20 standard as well as applications containing dependencies to other smart contracts.

      <td>Design of Anonymous Endorsement System in Hyperledger Fabric</td>
      <td>Permissioned Blockchain has become quite popular with enterprises forming consortium since it prioritizes trust over privacy. One of the popular platforms for distributed ledger solution, Hyperledger Fabric, requires a transaction to be endorsed or approved by a group of special members known as endorsers before undergoing validation. To endorse a transaction, an endorser mentions its identity along with the signature so that it can be verified later. However, for certain transactions, difference in opinion may exist among endorsers. Disclosing the identity of an endorser may lead to conflict within the consortium. In such cases, an endorsement policy which not only allows an endorser to support a transaction discreetly, but at the same time takes into account the decision of the majority is preferred. Thus we propose an Anonymous Endorsement System which uses a threshold endorsement policy in order to address the issue. To realize a t-out-of-n endorsement policy, using any of the existing threshold ring signature for our endorsement system would have violated the privacy of endorsers as either the identity or the secret key of the endorsers get revealed to the party who recombines the signature after collecting each signature share. All these factors motivated us to design a new ring signature scheme, called Fabric's Constant-Sized Linkable Ring Signature (FCsLRS) with Transaction-Oriented linkability for hiding identity of the endorsers. We have implemented the signature scheme in Golang and analyzed its security and performance by varying the RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) modulus size. Feasibility of implementation is supported by experimental analysis. Signature and tag generation time is quite fast and remains constant irrespective of change in message length or endorsement set size for a given RSA modulus value, assuming all the endorsers generates their signature in parallel. Each verifier is required to count and check individual valid ring signature. If the aggregate is above the threshold value, stated by the endorsement policy, then it confirms that the transaction is valid. This increases the verification time depending on the threshold value, but has very little effect on the scalability since generally $t \n. Lastly, we also discuss the integration of the scheme on v1.2 Hyperledger Fabric.</td>

      <td>SHARVOT: Secret SHARe-Based VOTing on the Blockchain</td>
      <td>Recently, there has been a growing interest in using online technologies to design protocols for secure electronic voting. The main challenges include vote privacy and anonymity, ballot irrevocability and transparency throughout the vote counting process. The introduction of the blockchain as a basis for cryptocurrency protocols, provides for the exploitation of the immutability and transparency properties of these distributed ledgers. In this paper, we discuss possible uses of the blockchain technology to implement a secure and fair voting system. In particular, we introduce a secret share-based voting system on the blockchain, the so-called SHARVOT protocol. Our solution uses Shamir's Secret Sharing to enable on-chain, i.e. within the transactions script, votes submission and winning candidate determination. The protocol is also using a shuffling technique, Circle Shuffle, to de-link voters from their submissions.</td>

      <td>Blockchain Consensus Protocols in the Wild</td>
      <td>A blockchain is a distributed ledger for recording transactions, maintained by many nodes without central authority through a distributed cryptographic protocol. All nodes validate the information to be appended to the blockchain, and a consensus protocol ensures that the nodes agree on a unique order in which entries are appended. Consensus protocols for tolerating Byzantine faults have received renewed attention because they also address blockchain systems. This work discusses the process of assessing and gaining confidence in the resilience of a consensus protocols exposed to faults and adversarial nodes. We advocate to follow the established practice in cryptography and computer security, relying on public reviews, detailed models, and formal proofs; the designers of several practical systems appear to be unaware of this. Moreover, we review the consensus protocols in some prominent permissioned blockchain platforms with respect to their fault models and resilience against attacks. The protocol comparison covers Hyperledger Fabric, Tendermint, Symbiont, R3~Corda, Iroha, Kadena, Chain, Quorum, MultiChain, Sawtooth Lake, Ripple, Stellar, and IOTA.</td>

      <td>Risks and Transaction Costs of Distributed-Ledger Fintech: Boundary Effects and Consequences</td>
      <td>Fintech business models based on distributed ledgers -- and their smart-contract variants in particular -- offer the prospect of democratizing access to faster, anywhere-accessible, lower cost, reliable-and-secure high-quality financial services. In addition to holding great, economically transformative promise, these business models pose new, little-studied risks and transaction costs. However, these risks and transaction costs are not evident during the demonstration and testing phases of development, when adopters and users are drawn from the community of developers themselves, as well as from among non-programmer fintech evangelists. Hence, when the new risks and transaction costs become manifest -- as the fintech business models are rolled out across the wider economy -- the consequences may also appear to be new and surprising. The present study represents an effort to get ahead of these developments by delineating risks and transaction costs inherent in distributed-ledger- and smart-contracts-based fintech business models. The analysis focuses on code risk and moral-hazard risk, as well as on mixed-economy risks and the unintended consequences of replicating bricks-and-mortar-generation contract forms within the ultra-low transaction-cost environment of fintech.</td>

      <td>TendrilStaller: Block Delay Attack in Bitcoin</td>
      <td>We present TendrilStaller, an eclipse attack targeting at Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network. TendrilStaller enables an adversary to delay block propagation to a victim for 10 minutes. The adversary thus impedes the victim from getting the latest blockchain state. It only takes as few as one Bitcoin full node and two light weight nodes to perform the attack. The light weight nodes perform a subset of the functions of a full Bitcoin node. The attack exploits a recent block propagation protocol introduced in April 2016. The protocol prescribes a Bitcoin node to select 3 neighbors that can send new blocks unsolicited. These neighbors are selected based on their recent performance in providing blocks quickly. The adversary induces the victim to select 3 attack nodes by having attack nodes send valid blocks to the victim more quickly than other neighbors. For this purpose, the adversary deploys a handful of light weight nodes so that the adversary itself receives new blocks faster. The adversary then performs the attack to delay blocks propagated to the victim. We implement the attack on top of current default Bitcoin protocol We deploy the attack nodes in multiple locations around the globe and randomly select victim nodes. Depending on the round-trip time between the adversary and the victim, 50%-85% of the blocks could be delayed to the victim. We further show that the adoption of light weight nodes greatly increases the attack probability by 15% in average. Finally, we propose several countermeasures to mitigate this eclipse attack.</td>

      <td>The concept of Bitcoin was first introduced by an unknown individual (or a group of people) named Satoshi Nakamoto before it was released as open-source software in 2009. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and a decentralized worldwide payment system for digital currency where transactions take place among users without any intermediary. Bitcoin transactions are performed and verified by network nodes and then registered in a public ledger called blockchain, which is maintained by network entities running Bitcoin software. To date, this cryptocurrency is worth close to U.S. $150 billion and widely traded across the world. However, as Bitcoin's popularity grows, many security concerns are coming to the forefront. Overall, Bitcoin security inevitably depends upon the distributed protocols-based stimulant-compatible proof-of-work that is being run by network entities called miners, who are anticipated to primarily maintain the blockchain (ledger). As a result, many researchers are exploring new threats to the entire system, introducing new countermeasures, and therefore anticipating new security trends. In this survey paper, we conduct an intensive study that explores key security concerns. We first start by presenting a global overview of the Bitcoin protocol as well as its major components. Next, we detail the existing threats and weaknesses of the Bitcoin system and its main technologies including the blockchain protocol. Last, we discuss current existing security studies and solutions and summarize open research challenges and trends for future research in Bitcoin security.</td>

Notably, Bitcoin has become popular since it maintains the anonymity of the users and enables peer-to-peer instant payments across the world. It is a decentralized money transfer protocol that does transactions without exposing user credentials and does verifications without any third-party intervention. Though it maintains anonymity, decentralization concept introduced vulnerabilities leading to severe security issues like double spending, block withholding and 51% attacks. These issues necessitate security specific enhancements in Bitcoin protocol. Therefore, this paper proposes a method of incorporating criteria check for miners to participate in mining process and a verification process to join the mining pool. The proposed idea mitigates double spending, block withholding, and 51% attacks. Further, a new approach is proposed namely, refining block creation and verification strategy for improving transaction rate without compromising security.</td>

      <td>Bitcoin is gaining traction as an alternative store of value. Its market capitalization transcends all other cryptocurrencies in the market. But its high monetary value also makes it an attractive target to cyber criminal actors. Hacking campaigns usually target the weakest points in an ecosystem. In Bitcoin, these are currently the exchange platforms. As each exchange breach potentially decreases Bitcoin's market value by billions, it is a threat not only to direct victims, but to everyone owning Bitcoin. Based on an extensive analysis of 36 breaches of Bitcoin exchanges, we show the attack patterns used to exploit Bitcoin exchange platforms using an industry standard for reporting intelligence on cyber security breaches. Based on this we are able to provide an overview of the most common attack vectors, showing that all except three hacks were possible due to relatively lax security. We also show that while the security regimen of Bitcoin exchanges is not on par with other financial service providers, the use of stolen credentials, which does not require any hacking, is decreasing. We also show that the amount of BTC taken during a breach is decreasing, as well as the exchanges that terminate after being breached. With exchanges being targeted by nation-state hacking groups, security needs to be a first concern.</td>

When two or more miners generate a block that includes transaction information at nearly the same time, an accidental fork occurs. In this case, the longest chain of blocks is selected to avoid the double-spending problem. However, if there is an attacker node whose hash power is greater than half of the total hash power, that node can perform a double-spending attack, i.e., a 51% or majority attack. We propose a random mining group selection technique to reduce the probability of successful double-spending attacks. The analysis results demonstrate that if the number of groups is greater than or equal to two, the probability that the attacker will find the next block is less than 50%.</td>

      <td>Security Properties of Light Clients on the Ethereum Blockchain</td>
      <td>Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain, known as being the second most popular public blockchain after Bitcoin. Since Ethereum is decentralised the canonical state is determined by the Ethereum network participants via a consensus mechanism without a centralized coordinator. The network participants are required to evaluate every transaction starting from the genesis block, which requires a large amount of network, computing, and storage resources. This is impractical for many devices with either limited computing resources or intermittent network connectivity. To overcome this drawback Ethereum defines a light client protocol where the light client fetches the blockchain state from a node operating as a light protocol server. Light clients are unable to maintain blockchain state internally, and as a consequence can only perform partial validation on blocks. Thus they rely on the light server for full block validation and to provide the updated blockchain state. Light clients connect to multiple light servers to mitigate the risk of relying on a single potentially dishonest server. Ethereum light clients are known to suffer from a probabilistic security model, but they are widely assumed to be secure under normal operating conditions. In fact, the implicit security assumptions of light clients have not been formally characterised in the literature. We present and analyse the probabilistic security guarantees under three different adversarial scenarios. The results show that for any adversary that is able to manipulate the network, the security assurances provided by the light protocol are severely impacted, and in some cases entirely lost. These results clearly demonstrate that the assumption of normal operating conditions is insufficient to justify the security assumptions of light clients. Our work also provides insight to the security of light clients under different security parameters, allowing light client implementers to more accurately understand the potential security trade-offs.</td>

      <td>When Bitcoin was first introduced to the world in 2008 by an enigmatic programmer going by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, it was billed as the world's first decentralized virtual currency. Offering the first credible incarnation of a digital currency, Bitcoin was based on the principal of peer to peer transactions involving a complex public address and a private key that only the owner of the coin would know. This paper will seek to investigate how the usage and value of Bitcoin is affected by current events in the cyber environment. Is an advancement in the digital security of Bitcoin reflected by the value of the currency and conversely does a major security breech have a negative effect? By analyzing statistical data of the market value of Bitcoin at specific points where the currency has fluctuated dramatically, it is believed that trends can be found. This paper proposes that based on the data analyzed, the current integrity of the Bitcoin security is trusted by general users and the value and usage of the currency is growing. All the major fluctuations of the currency can be linked to significant events within the digital security environment however these fluctuations are beginning to decrease in frequency and severity. Bitcoin is still a volatile currency but this paper concludes that this is a result of security flaws in Bitcoin services as opposed to the Bitcoin protocol itself.</td>

In order to achieve this, Mining pools distribute amongst the workers the task of finding a block so that each worker works on a different subset of the candidate solutions. In most mining pools the selection of transactions to be part of the next block is performed by the pool manager and thus becomes more centralized. A mining Pool is expected to give priority to the most lucrative transactions in order to increase the block reward however changes to the transaction policy done without notification of workers would be difficult to detect. In this paper we treat the transaction selection policy performed by miners as a classification problem; for each block we create a dataset, separate them by mining pool and apply feature selection techniques to extract a vector of importance for each feature. We then track variations in feature importance as new blocks arrive and show using a generated scenario how a change in policy by a mining pool could be detected.</td>

If the dust attacks occur in the blockchain, which sends large amounts of dust transactions to the blockchain, the time of transactions' confirmation will be more longer, which will lead to more security problems, such as double-spending or blockchain forks. In order to identify and prevent dust attacks, this paper proposes an innovative Anti-Dust security model, which analyzes the characteristics of dust attacks and learns from the historical transactions big data, uses the Gaussian distribution to construct a dust recognition algorithm. At the same time, a dust transaction pool will be added to improve the blockchain architecture. In the experiment, a large amount of dust transactions will be send to the blockchain. Taking 50000 dust attacks and 500 normal transactions as an example, the conformation time of blockchain without Anti-Dust is about 20000 seconds, and Anti-Dust is about 210 seconds.

      <td>Mining Strategies for Completing the Longest Blockchain</td>
      <td>Bitcoin is an innovative decentralized cryptocurrency that records transactions in a public log, termed the blockchain. Due to delays in the Bitcoin network, the Bitcoin blockchain has the potential for forming forks. In this paper, we consider a mining strategy in which the player who created the fork can attract other miners by posting rewards and the third party (other miners) has the ability to choose the fork based on their interests. We provide a model to formalize the considered case and analyze its feasibility. Based on certain game theoretical models, the best policies for two players, termed the creator of the fork and the third party, are presented. Finally, some cases of the considered model are simulated, and the average revenue of each player is compared with the theoretical revenue to verify the correctness of our strategy. When the delay varies from 0 to 400 milliseconds, adopting our strategy can acquire 23% more revenue than adopting the default strategy. The result shows that the default strategy of a miner is not always a good choice.</td>

      <td>A double-spend attack is one of the major security issues in most blockchain systems, but it is difficult to successfully launch unless an adversary has massive computing power. In this paper, we introduce a new attack model that combines a double-spend attack with a Sybil attack in the Bitcoin network. We present analysis results that a double-spending attacker can make a block propagation delay by conducting Sybil attacks and increase the probability of winning the mining race, thus successfully launching the double-spend attack. We develop the probability of success of this new attack in mathematics forms and analyze this attack model from the perspective of economics. We present the attacker's break-even point in various situations and demonstrate the effect of the proposed attack.</td>

      <td>Behind closed doors: measurement and analysis of CryptoLocker ransoms in Bitcoin</td>
      <td>Bitcoin, a decentralized cryptographic currency that has experienced proliferating popularity over the past few years, is the common denominator in a wide variety of cybercrime. We perform a measurement analysis of CryptoLocker, a family of ransomware that encrypts a victim's files until a ransom is paid, within the Bitcoin ecosystem from September 5, 2013 through January 31, 2014. Using information collected from online fora, such as reddit and BitcoinTalk, as an initial starting point, we generate a cluster of 968 Bitcoin addresses belonging to CryptoLocker. We provide a lower bound for CryptoLocker's economy in Bitcoin and identify 795 ransom payments totalling 1,128.40 BTC ($310,472.38), but show that the proceeds could have been worth upwards of $1.1 million at peak valuation. By analyzing ransom payment timestamps both longitudinally across CryptoLocker's operating period and transversely across times of day, we detect changes in distributions and form conjectures on CryptoLocker that corroborate information from previous efforts. Additionally, we construct a network topology to detail CryptoLocker's financial infrastructure and obtain auxiliary information on the CryptoLocker operation. Most notably, we find evidence that suggests connections to popular Bitcoin services, such as Bitcoin Fog and BTC-e, and subtle links to other cybercrimes surrounding Bitcoin, such as the Sheep Marketplace scam of 2013. We use our study to underscore the value of measurement analyses and threat intelligence in understanding the erratic cybercrime landscape.</td>

      <td>Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008, blockchain systems have seen an enormous increase in adoption. By providing a persistent, distributed, and append-only ledger, blockchains enable numerous applications such as distributed consensus, robustness against equivocation, and smart contracts. However, recent studies show that blockchain systems such as Bitcoin can be (mis) used to store arbitrary content. This has already been used to store arguably objectionable content on Bitcoin's blockchain. Already single instances of clearly objectionable or even illegal content can put the whole system at risk by making its node operators culpable. To overcome this imminent risk, we survey and discuss the design space of countermeasures against the insertion of such objectionable content. Our analysis shows a wide spectrum of potential countermeasures, which are often combinable for increased efficiency. First, we investigate special-purpose content detectors as an ad hoc mitigation. As they turn out to be easily evadable, we also investigate content-agnostic countermeasures. We find that mandatory minimum fees as well as mitigation of transaction manipulability via identifier commitments significantly raise the bar for inserting harmful content into a blockchain.</td>

      <td>We address two problems: first, we study a variant of block withholding (BWH) attack in Bitcoins and second, we propose solutions to prevent all existing types of BWH attacks in Bitcoins. We analyze the strategies of a selfish Bitcoin miner who in connivance with one pool attacks another pool and receives reward from the former mining pool for attacking the latter. We name this attack as “sponsored block withholding attack.” We present detailed quantitative analysis of the monetary incentive that a selfish miner can earn by adopting this strategy under different scenarios. We prove that under certain conditions, the attacker can maximize her revenue by adopting some strategies and by utilizing her computing power wisely. We also show that an attacker may use this strategy for attacking both the pools for earning higher amount of incentives. More importantly, we present a strategy that can effectively counter block withholding attack in any mining pool. First, we propose a generic scheme that uses cryptographic commitment schemes to counter BWH attack. Then, we suggest an alternative implementation of the same scheme using hash function. Our scheme protects a pool from rogue miners as well as rogue pool administrators. The scheme and its variant defend against BWH attack by making it impossible for the miners to distinguish between a partial proof of work and a complete proof of work. The scheme is so designed that the administrator cannot cheat on the entire pool. The scheme can be implemented by making minor changes to existing Bitcoin protocol. We also analyze the security of the scheme.</td>

Numerical results show that the proposed FMA can obtain the same storage fitness compared with GA and TSA for the case of the small number of nodes. GA is able to outperform the other two algorithms in terms of storage fitness, and the solution quality of TSA is bound by the qualities of FMA and GA.</td>

      <td>An Evaluation of Uncle Block Mechanism Effect on Ethereum Selfish and Stubborn Mining Combined With an Eclipse Attack</td>
      <td>Ethereum accelerates the transaction process through a quicker block creation design. Since the time interval between the generation of blocks is very short (about 15s), block propagation time in an inefficient network is not negligible compared with the block time interval. This lead to the production of a large number of orphan blocks. In order to solve the security problems that may be caused by the orphan block and improve the transaction processing efficiency, Ethereum introduces the uncle block mechanism, i.e., an orphan block may get part of minted reward if it gets a reference by a regular block. In this paper, we show the weakness of the uncle block mechanism. Firstly, we describe the specific differences of Ethereum selfish and stubborn mining in every state from the ones in Bitcoin. Secondly, we simulate possible attacks, and the results show that the Ethereum selfish and stubborn mining strategies not only increase the reward of an attacker but also decrease the security threshold. The security threshold refers to the proportion of the attacker's computational power that needs to be achieved in order to obtain a higher reward than he should. In a practical network congestion rate, the security threshold are weakened to 0.129 and 0.216 against the Lead stubborn mining strategy and the original selfish mining strategy, respectively. When the congestion rate is rising, the reward is increasing and the threshold is decreasing. Thirdly, possible strategies are evaluated to find out the optimal one in different settings. Fourthly, we also extend the evaluation by combining three eclipse attack strategies with selfish or stubborn mining. Most of combinations bring more advantages to an attacker than a single strategy.</td>

      <td>Ethereum is a kind of blockchain platform where developers may develop and run programs called smart contracts. It inherently relies on gas consumption within a specified allowance to constrain code execution, making every instruction along an execution path to be a location for raising an exception. In this paper, we present GasFuzzer, the first work in exploring the effects of gas allowance manipulation to expose gas-oriented exception security vulnerabilities. GasFuzzer consists of two phases. The first phase introduces a gas-greedy strategy to favor transactions having higher gas consumption for mutation to obtain test transactions with different gas consumptions. The second phase introduces a novel notion of fractional gas consumption coverage and a novel gas-leveling strategy. It applies them to mutate the gas allowances of some of these transactions resulting in the highest gas consumptions produced in the first phase followed by applying these allowance-mutated transactions together with those which remained non-mutated to fuzz test the smart contract. We report an evaluation of GasFuzzer via an experiment on 3170 real-world smart contracts deployed on the public Ethereum Blockchain between October 2017 and July 2019. The findings show that GasFuzzer with gas-greedy strategy can detect more Exceptions Disorder kind of security vulnerabilities (7 more cases) than the previous state-of-the-art black-box fuzzer, and GasFuzzer with gas-leveling strategy and gas coverage criterion can detect 6 additional cases of Exceptions Disorder security vulnerabilities, which is significant.</td>

      <td>Blockchain miners processing the transactions and generating blocks are rational and incentivized by financial rewards. Prior research in blockchain security studied such financial incentives for the miners and identified attacks based on withholding and delaying block submissions. Among such attacks, the fork-after-withholding (FAW) attack is the state of the art and provides practical incentives to the rational attacker by increasing its reward at the expense of the rest of the miners in the compromised pool. To defend against FAW attack, we propose Silent Timestamping, which has the mining pool manager enforce the ordering of the shares. Implemented at the mining pool manager, Silent Timestamping does not require networking nor any behavior-or implementation-changes in the miners; the lack of the implementation overheads distinguish Silent Timestamping from other schemes which have been proposed but had limited success in practice. We analyze the optimal attacker behavior against Silent Timestamping and the effectiveness of Silent Timestamping against FAW attack. Silent Timestamping effectively nullifies the reward gain of the FAW attack and reduces the optimal FAW attacker strategy to be either the suboptimal block-withholding attack (which never submits the withheld block in the compromised pool and provides limited incentives for a rational attacker) or honest mining.</td>

      <td>Blockchain technology is useful with the record keeping of digital transactions, IoT, supply chain management etc. However, we have observed that the traditional attacks are possible on blockchain due to lack of robust identity management. We found that Sybil attack can cause severe impact in public/permissionless blockchain, in which an attacker can subvert the blockchain by creating a large number of pseudonymous identities (i.e. Fake user accounts) and push legitimate entities in the minority. Such virtual nodes can act like genuine nodes to create disproportionately large influence on the network. This may lead to several other attacks like DoS, DDoS etc. In this paper, a Sybil attack is demonstrated on a blockchain test bed with its impact on the throughput of the system. We propose a solution directive, in which each node monitors the behavior of other nodes and checks for the nodes which are forwarding the blocks of only particular user. Such nodes are quickly identified, blacklisted and notified to other nodes, and thus the Sybil attack can be restricted. We analyze experimental results of the proposed solution.</td>

      <td>Decentralization is Vulnerable Under the Gap Game</td>
      <td>The blockchain is the core mechanism of Bitcoin, which is mainly enabled by a distributed consensus mechanism. Essentially, in Proof-of-Work-based consensus protocol, the miners generate a series of blocks to realize decentralization practical. Miners receive two types of revenue: block rewards and transaction fees, in which the reward of block drops off as time goes on. Carlsten et al. defined a mining gap and then Tsabary et al. analyzed the gap game exploring how mining gaps form. In this paper, we analyze the other implications of the gap game. First, it is well known that the security of Bitcoin decentralized consensus protocol relies on miners behaving correctly. The security of the blockchain system will be threatened in case of the consensus mechanism is breached. Therefore, we also described how the gap game impacts the decentralization of Bitcoin and the stability of blockchain. Second, to confirm the implication, we discuss what aspects of decentralization can be impacted by the gap game; then we defined a new decentralization model and listed its main features. In the end, we analyze the block reward capacity in the blockchain and consider the impact on the existing two common block reward systems when the gap game was formed.</td>

For example, it takes several hours for BitCoin and several minutes for Ethereum. These cryptocurrencies also consume a high quantity of electricity for transaction validation. Even though there currently is a type of cryptocurrencies, Ripple, that can be quickly transferred in 4 seconds but still it is a closed system with an owner, not a public cryptocurrency. Similarly, an algorithm "Proof of Stake" used by new coins that are more energy-saving but several problems are still found including (1) 51% attack, (2) a richer with more coins gains higher rewards, and (3) a problematic node for block validation that is not currently active. This research presents a model of an open cryptocurrency system that is able to transfer a coin within 3 seconds in which an algorithm called "Random-Checkers Proof of Stake" (RCPoS) was proposed to randomly select the inspectors for validation processes which can avoid those three problems of the Proof of Stake.</td>

      <td>Modeling the Impact of Network Connectivity on Consensus Security of Proof-of-Work Blockchain</td>
      <td>Blockchain, the technology behind the popular Bitcoin, is considered a "security by design" system as it is meant to create security among a group of distrustful parties yet without a central trusted authority. The security of blockchain relies on the premise of honest-majority, namely, the blockchain system is assumed to be secure as long as the majority of consensus voting power is honest. And in the case of proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain, adversaries cannot control more than 50% of the network's gross computing power. However, this 50% threshold is based on the analysis of computing power only, with implicit and idealistic assumptions on the network and node behavior. Recent researches have alluded that factors such as network connectivity, presence of blockchain forks, and mining strategy could undermine the consensus security assured by the honest-majority, but neither concrete analysis nor quantitative evaluation is provided. In this paper we fill the gap by proposing an analytical model to assess the impact of network connectivity on the consensus security of PoW blockchain under different adversary models. We apply our analytical model to two adversarial scenarios: 1) honest-but-potentially-colluding, 2) selfish mining. For each scenario, we quantify the communication capability of nodes involved in a fork race and estimate the adversary's mining revenue and its impact on security properties of the consensus protocol. Simulation results validated our analysis. Our modeling and analysis provide a paradigm for assessing the security impact of various factors in a distributed consensus system.</td>

      <td>Security Implications of Blockchain Cloud with Analysis of Block Withholding Attack</td>
      <td>The blockchain technology has emerged as an attractive solution to address performance and security issues in distributed systems. Blockchain's public and distributed peer-to-peer ledger capability benefits cloud computing services which require functions such as, assured data provenance, auditing, management of digital assets, and distributed consensus. Blockchain's underlying consensus mechanism allows to build a tamper-proof environment, where transactions on any digital assets are verified by set of authentic participants or miners. With use of strong cryptographic methods, blocks of transactions are chained together to enable immutability on the records. However, achieving consensus demands computational power from the miners in exchange of handsome reward. Therefore, greedy miners always try to exploit the system by augmenting their mining power. In this paper, we first discuss blockchain's capability in providing assured data provenance in cloud and present vulnerabilities in blockchain cloud. We model the block withholding (BWH) attack in a blockchain cloud considering distinct pool reward mechanisms. BWH attack provides rogue miner ample resources in the blockchain cloud for disrupting honest miners' mining efforts, which was verified through simulations.</td>

      <td>Bit coin is a decentralized P2P digital currency in which coins are generated by a distributed set of miners and transactions are broadcasted via a peer-to-peer network. While Bit coin provides some level of anonymity (or rather pseudonymity) by encouraging the users to have any number of random-looking Bit coin addresses, recent research shows that this level of anonymity is rather low. This encourages users to connect to the Bit coin network through anonymizers like Tor and motivates development of default Tor functionality for popular mobile SPV clients. In this paper we show that combining Tor and Bit coin creates a new attack vector. A low-resource attacker can gain full control of information flows between all users who chose to use Bit coin over Tor. In particular the attacker can link together user's transactions regardless of pseudonyms used, control which Bit coin blocks and transactions are relayed to user and can delay or discard user's transactions and blocks. Moreover, we show how an attacker can fingerprint users and then recognize them and learn their IP addresses when they decide to connect to the Bit coin network directly.</td>

Because of the asynchrony of network, the competition of mining, and the nondeterministic block propagation delay, forks in the blockchain occur frequently which not only waste a lot of computing resources but also result in potential security issues. This paper introduces PvScheme, a probabilistic verification scheme that can effectively reduce the block propagation delay and hence reduce the occurrence of blockchain forks. We further enhance the security of PvScheme to provide reliable block delivery. We also analyze the resistance of PvScheme to fake blocks and double spending attacks.

In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game theoretic analysis of Proof-of-Work (PoW) based blockchain network in order to investigate the mining pool dynamics affected by malicious infiltrators and the feasibility of autonomous migration among individual miners. We formulate a revenue model for mining pools which are implicitly allowed to launch a block withholding attack. Under our mining game, we analyze the evolutionary stability of Nash equilibrium with replicator dynamics, which can explain the population change with time between participated pools. Further, we explore the statistical approximation of successful mining events to show the necessity of artificial manipulation for migrating. Finally, we construct a better response learning based on the required block size which can lead to our evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) with numerical results that support our theoretical discoveries.</td>

However, much of the interest in DLTs stems from their potential to decentralise, disintermediate, and enable `trustless' interactions. At first sight, BaaS - being offered by a provider - appears to run counter to this. In practice, whether BaaS raises substantive trust concerns depends on the nature of the offering, the application's specifics, and the participants' goals and risk appetite. This paper elaborates the nature of BaaS and explores the trust considerations it raises, particularly regarding the role of providers as part of a wider infrastructure.</td>

      <td>Polynomial-based Lightweight Key Management in a Permissioned Blockchain</td>
      <td>A permissioned blockchain platform comes with numerous assurances such as transaction confidentiality and system scalability to several organizations. Most permissioned blockchains rely on a Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI)as cryptographic tools to provide security services such as identity authentication and data confidentiality. Using PKI to validate transactions includes validating digital certificates of endorsement peers which creates an overhead in the system. Because public-key operations are computationally intensive, they limit the scalability of blockchain applications. Due to a large modulus size and expensive modular exponentiation operations, public-key operations such as RSA become slower than polynomial-based schemes, which involve a smaller modulus size and a less smaller number of modular multiplications. For instance, the 2048-bit RSA is approximately 15,728 times slower than a polynomial with a degree of 50 and 128-bit modulus size. In this paper, we propose a lightweight polynomial-based key management scheme in the context of a permissioned blockchain. Our scheme involves computationally less intensive polynomial evaluation operations such as additions and multiplications that result in a faster processing compared with public-key schemes. In addition, our proposed solution reduces the overhead of processing transactions and improves the system scalability. Security and performance analysis are provided in the paper.</td>

      <td>Trust-Based Shard Distribution Scheme for Fault-Tolerant Shard Blockchain Networks</td>
      <td>Blockchains guarantee data integrity through consensus of distributed ledgers based on multiple validation nodes called miners. For this reason, any blockchain system can be critically disabled by a malicious attack from a majority of the nodes (e.g., 51% attack). These attacks are more likely to succeed as the number of nodes required for consensus is smaller. Recently, as blockchains are becoming too large (making them difficult to store, send, receive, and manage), sharding is being considered as a technology to help improve the transaction throughput and scalability of blockchains. Sharding distributes block validators to disjoint sets to process transactions in parallel. Therefore, the number of validators of each shard group is smaller, which makes shard-based blockchains more vulnerable to 51% attacks than blockchains that do not use sharding. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a trust-based shard distribution (TBSD) scheme that assigns potential malicious nodes in the network to different shards, preventing malicious nodes from gaining a dominating influence on the consensus of a single shard. TBSD uses a trust-based shard distribution scheme to prevent malicious miners from gathering in on one shard by integration of a trust management system and genetic algorithm (GA). First, the trust of all nodes is computed based on the previous consensus result. Then, a GA is used to compute the shard distribution set to prevent collusion of malicious miners. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed TBSD scheme results in a shard distribution with a higher level of fairness than existing schemes, which provides an improved level of protection against malicious attacks.</td>

      <td>Security Assurance for Smart Contract</td>
      <td>Currently, Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two most popular cryptocurrency systems, especially Ethereum. It permits complex financial transactions or rules through scripts, which is called smart contracts. Since Ethereum smart contracts hold millions of dollars, their execution correctness is crucial against attacks which aim at stealing the assets. In this paper, we proposed a security assurance method for smart contract source code to find potential security risks. It contains two main functions, the first is syntax topological analysis of smart contract invocation relationship, to help developers to understand their code structure clearly; the second is logic risk (which may lead to vulnerabilities) detection and location, and label results on topology diagram. For developers' convenience, we have built a static analysis tool called SASC to generate topology diagram of invocation relationship and to find potential logic risks. We have made an evaluation on 2,952 smart contracts, experiment results proved that our method is intuitive and effective.</td>

      <td>Pool Strategies Selection in PoW-Based Blockchain Networks: Game-Theoretic Analysis</td>
      <td>In proof-of-work-based (PoW-based) blockchain networks, the miners participate in a crypto-puzzle solving competition to win the reward by publishing a new block. Open mining pools attract a large number of miners for solving difficult problems together. Although the open strategy is likely to be more efficient, it makes pools susceptible to attack at the same time. In this paper, we present a game-theoretic analysis of mining pool strategy selection in order to explore the trade-off between the efficiency of openness and the vulnerability of attacks in a PoW-based blockchain network. We first model the pool mining process as a two-stage game, wherein the pools might decide whether to open or not and to attack or not. Based on the two-stage game model, we analyze the Nash equilibrium and the evolutionary stability of the mining games among pools, which uncovers the pool selection dynamics of PoW-based blockchain networks. In particular, we find that the attack behavior is the norm for a weak pool and triggers lower expected utilities when punishing the attacks more severely. Numerical simulations also support our theoretical findings as well as demonstrate the stability of the pools’ strategy selection.</td>

      <td>We describe a general attack on proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains without checkpointing. Our attack leverages transaction fees, the ability to treat transactions "out of context," and the standard longest chain rule to completely dominate a blockchain. The attack grows in power with the number of honest transactions and the stake held by the adversary, and can be launched by an adversary controlling any constant fraction of the stake. With the present statistical profile of blockchain protocols, the attack can be launched given a few years of prior blockchain operation; hence it is within the realm of feasibility for PoS protocols. Most importantly, it demonstrates how closely transaction fees and rewards are coupled with the security properties of PoS protocols. More broadly, our attack must be reflected and countered in any future PoS design that avoids checkpointing, as well as any effort to remove checkpointing from existing protocols. We describe several mechanisms for protecting against the attack that include context-sensitivity of transactions and chain density statistics.</td>

To make such an investment, decision makers need answers to a number of questions including: what existing business problems will be solved, will blockchain solve them, and what long term benefits and new business opportunities blockchain can create. In this paper we analyze security aspects of these questions, focusing on the protection of integrity of data and financial transactions. We start from the analysis of an essential security architecture of financial systems which is based on the perimeter protection and traditional business process safeguards such as maker-checker. Subsequently, we look at the options on how to improve such an architecture to provide protection against malicious internal users and malware implanted inside the system; the vulnerabilities that have been exploited by organized criminal teams of attackers in the attacks seen lately. We show that the improvements based on the preventive safeguards, inherent to blockchain security architecture, provide strong protection against those attacks. Finally, we argue that in comparison with typically used detective measures (e.g. monitoring), security architecture based on the blockchain model provides superior protection against attacks using attack scenarios never seen before.</td>

      <td>Gigahorse: Thorough, Declarative Decompilation of Smart Contracts</td>
      <td>The rise of smart contracts - autonomous applications running on blockchains - has led to a growing number of threats, necessitating sophisticated program analysis. However, smart contracts, which transact valuable tokens and cryptocurrencies, are compiled to very low-level bytecode. This bytecode is the ultimate semantics and means of enforcement of the contract. We present the Gigahorse toolchain. At its core is a reverse compiler (i.e., a decompiler) that decompiles smart contracts from Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode into a highlevel 3-address code representation. The new intermediate representation of smart contracts makes implicit data- and control-flow dependencies of the EVM bytecode explicit. Decompilation obviates the need for a contract's source and allows the analysis of both new and deployed contracts. Gigahorse advances the state of the art on several fronts. It gives the highest analysis precision and completeness among decompilers for Ethereum smart contracts - e.g., Gigahorse can decompile over 99.98% of deployed contracts, compared to 88% for the recently-published Vandal decompiler and under 50% for the state-of-the-practice Porosity decompiler. Importantly, Gigahorse offers a full-featured toolchain for further analyses (and a “batteries included” approach, with multiple clients already implemented), together with the highest performance and scalability. Key to these improvements is Gigahorse's use of a declarative, logic-based specification, which allows high-level insights to inform low-level decompilation.</td>

      <td>Smart Contract: Attacks and Protections</td>
      <td>Smart contracts are programs that reside within decentralized blockchains and are executed pursuant to triggered instructions. A smart contract acts in a similar way to a traditional agreement but negates the necessity for the involvement of a third party. Smart contracts are capable of initiating their commands automatically, thus eliminating the involvement of a regulatory body. As a consequence of blockchain's immutable feature, smart contracts are developed in a manner that is distinct from traditional software. Once deployed to the blockchain, a smart contract cannot be modified or updated for security patches, thus encouraging developers to implement strong security strategies before deployment in order to avoid potential exploitation at a later time. However, the most recent dreadful attacks and the multifarious existing vulnerabilities which result as a consequence of the absence of security patches have challenged the sustainability of this technology. Attacks such as the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) attack and the Parity Wallet hack have cost millions of dollars simply as a consequence of naïve bugs in the smart contract code. In this paper, we classify blockchain exploitation techniques into 4 categories based on the attack rationale; attacking consensus protocols, bugs in the smart contract, malware running in the operating system, and fraudulent users. We then focus on smart contract vulnerabilities, analyzing the 7 most important attack techniques to determine the real impact on smart contract technology. We reveal that even adopting the 10 most widely used tools to detect smart contract vulnerabilities, these still contain known vulnerabilities, providing a dangerously false sense of security. We conclude the paper with a discussion about recommendations and future research lines to progress towards a secure smart contract solution.</td>

      <td>The impact of communication transmission delay on the original blockchain, has not been well considered and studied since it is primarily designed in stable wired communication environment with high communication capacity. However, in a wireless scenario, due to the scarcity of spectrum resource, a blockchain user may have to compete for wireless channel to broadcast transactions following media access control (MAC) mechanism. As a result, the communication transmission delay may be significant and pose a bottleneck on the blockchain system performance and security. To facilitate blockchain applications in wireless industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs), this article aims to investigate whether the widely used MAC mechanism, carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), is suitable for wireless blockchain networks or not. Based on tangle, as an example to analyze the system performance in term of confirmation delay, transaction per second and transaction loss probability by considering the impact of queueing and transmission delay caused by CSMA/CA. Next, a stochastic model is proposed to analyze the security issue taking into account the malicious double-spending attack. Simulation results provide valuable insights when running blockchain in wireless network, the performance would be limited by the traditional CSMA/CA protocol. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that the probability of launching a successful double-spending attack would be affected by CSMA/CA as well.</td>

      <td>Application of Rank-Weight Methods to Blockchain Cybersecurity Vulnerability Assessment Framework</td>
      <td>Cybersecurity vulnerability assessment tools, frameworks, and methodologies are used to understand the cybersecurity maturity of a system or a facility. However, these tools are strictly developed based on standards defined by organizations such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the U.S. Department of Energy; the majority of these tools and frameworks do not provide a platform to prioritize the requirements to reach a desired cybersecurity maturity. To address that challenge, we have been developing a framework and software application called cybersecurity vulnerability mitigation framework through empirical paradigm (CyFEr). CyFEr treats the problem at hand as a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) problem, which requires that various criteria be weighed relatively. Defining those weights is non-trivial and often leads to subjective decisions leading to undesired complications. To facilitate such a weighting system in CyFEr, we evaluated the application of various rank-weight methods (such as rank sum, reciprocal rank, rank exponent, and rank order centroid). The efficacy of those rank-weight methods was evaluated by applying them and testing against the blockchain cybersecurity framework (BC2F). BC2F was developed using the NIST cybersecurity framework to evaluate the cybersecurity posture of the blockchain nodes and networks in a given blockchain application or use-case. This paper provides 1) technical insights on the application of rank-weight methods to cybersecurity vulnerability assessments, 2) an overview of BC2F, 3) the application of rank-weight methods to BC2F, and 4) a depiction of the integration of the discussed rank-weight methods in CyFEr.</td>

In order to utilize the newly acquired data, we added an analysis module to detect fallback functions, whose execution may exceed the defined threshold of gas.

      <td>Cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum), which promise to become the future of money transactions, are mainly implemented with blockchain technology. However, blockchain suffers from scalability issues. Sharding is the leading solution for blockchain scalability. Sharding splits the blockchain network into sub-chains called shards/committees. Each shard processes a sub-set of transactions, rather than the entire network processing all transactions. This raises security issues for sharding-based blockchain protocols. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to analyze the security of these protocols (e.g., OmniLedger and RapidChain). In particular, this methodology estimates the failure probability of one sharding round taking into consideration the failure probabilities of all shards. To illustrate the effectiveness of the estimated failure probability, we conduct a numerical analysis of our methodology based on a huge number of trials. Finally, we compute confidence intervals to accurately estimate the failure probability and compare our methodology with existing approaches.</td>

      <td>The success and popularity of Bitcoin mainly focuses the underlying blockchain technology which is totally immutable distributed ledger, highly secured by its P2P network consensus named Proof of Work (PoW). One of the worst threats to a Proof-of-Work based cryptocurrency is 51% attack. If one or more dishonest network peer gains more than 50% of resource such as processing power, then they will become the majority decision maker in the network. It is already proved that mixing of two or more existing protocol that is called hybrid protocol can make the network enough resistive to this attack. The recent implementations of hybrid protocols have other limitations and problems that they are facing and striving to resolve. But their main weakness is in distribution of block mining reward to the investors. From the perspective of an investor, an investor invests his hard-earned money in a cryptocurrency for making proper profit from his investment. The main source of this profit is the block reward which is generated and given to the miner on successful mining of a block. So, to ensure this profit is given to proper user on proper time interval, the consistency of block generation time interval is a vital factor. The voting system, ticket system etc. are not time controlled and over all block reward generation interval will not show a uniform distribution of profit. Another big issue is diversifying the peers by creating special committee and groups of validators the concept of P2P network is violated. In this paper we will describe a step by step process to implement a Hybrid PoW-PoS based consensus protocol. In our proposed system, the PoW mining process is only used to regulate the block generation time. The actual block generation is done by the same user with PoS consensus mechanism. There is no voting or validating committee. The entire network will validate each block. This is the major difference with other discussed system. The system will not only be able to tackle the 51% attack, it provides a uniform distribution of mining reward to the stake holders and investors by maintaining a precise block generation interval with difficulty adjustment in PoW mining and probability calculation for stake holders according to their matured staking balance. We will not only show how to make the system non-vulnerable to this attack but also describe in detail about how to validate the transactions and blocks in different stage of creating the block chain.</td>

However, the increased attack surface offered by the growing number of connected vulnerable devices and complex nature of SDN control plane applications could overturn the huge benefits of such a system. This paper addresses the vulnerability of some unspecified security flaw in the SDN control plane application (such as a zero-day software vulnerability) which can be exploited to insert malicious flow rules in the switch that do not match network policies. Specifically, we propose a blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) based framework that supports switch flow verification and insertion; and additionally provides straightforward deployment of blockchain technology within an existing SDN infrastructure. While use of an external BaaS brings straightforward deployment, it obscures knowledge of the blockchain agents who are responsible for flow conformance testing through a smart blockchain contract, leading to potential exploitation. Thus, we design a strategy to prevent the blockchain agents from acting arbitrarily, as this would result in what is termed a “moral hazard”. We achieve this by developing a novel mathematical model of the fair reward scheme based on game theory. To understand the performance of our system, we evaluate our model using a Matlab based simulation framework. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm balances the needs of the blockchain agents to maximise the overall social welfare, i.e. the sum of profits across all parties.</td>

The forking attack is the kind of hazard behavior that aims to replace the MTC by launching an alternative chain to gain benefits. Blockchain plays a vital role in multiple applications, such as cryptocurrency, and hence such forking attack leads to huge financial loss if it succeeds. In this paper, we propose a novel MTC confirmation mechanism to defend the forking attack. First, we theoretically analyze the success probability distribution of the forking attack and propose an estimation model of the attack's expected profit. Then, we propose an arbitration mechanism to enforce branches from a fork to have competition. With the arbitration mechanism, we delay the confirmation of the MTC until the end of the competition. We set up an end threshold as the termination condition of the competition process to help the MTC become the winner. Finally, we define two dynamic difficulty factors and apply them for changing the difficulty of mining to reduce the value of the end threshold, which can improve the performance of the mechanism. The experiments demonstrate our proposed MTC confirmation mechanism can enhance the blockchain security by enforcing the expected profit of an attack to be negative. In the meantime, the mechanism balances well in both effectiveness and efficiency.</td>

      <td>Research on the Selection Strategies of Blockchain Mining Pools</td>
      <td>Since the increasing popularization of the emerging blockchain technology, blockchain mining has attracted more and more attention. Due to the difficulty of solo mining, typically miners choose to join a mining pool. As there are many mining pools and different mining pools may adopt different reward mechanisms, how to choose the appropriate mining pool has become one of the most important issues faced by miners, since miners can get different rewards in different pools. In practice, there are three commonly used reward mechanisms for the mining pools to distribute the reward among their miners, namely, the proportional mechanism, the pay-per-share mechanism, and the pay-per-last-N-share mechanism. In this paper, we study the pool selection problem faced by the miners, and model it as a risk decision problem since different reward mechanisms have different risks. We establish a pool selection model based on the maximum-likelihood criterion and also study the effect of N on the miners' optimal pool selection decisions. By utilizing the computational experiments approach, we validate our proposed pool selection strategies. Our results can provide important managerial insights for miners when making their pool selection decisions.</td>

Mobile money becomes the new monopoly of MMOs in an economic system where the rate of unbanked adults is very high. Currently in 2019 Orange Money makes nearly 1.5 million transactions per day, which corresponds to a monetary value of nearly 15 billion CFA francs per day.

      <td>Smart Contract Security: A Software Lifecycle Perspective</td>
      <td>Smart contract security is an emerging research area that deals with security issues arising from the execution of smart contracts in a blockchain system. Generally, a smart contract is a piece of executable code that automatically runs on the blockchain to enforce an agreement preset between parties involved in the transaction. As an innovative technology, smart contracts have been applied in various business areas, such as digital asset exchange, supply chains, crowdfunding, and intellectual property. Unfortunately, many security issues in smart contracts have been reported in the media, often leading to substantial financial losses. These security issues pose new challenges to security research because the execution environment of smart contracts is based on blockchain computing and its decentralized nature of execution. Thus far, many partial solutions have been proposed to address specific aspects of these security issues, and the trend is to develop new methods and tools to automatically detect common security vulnerabilities. However, smart contract security is systematic engineering that should be explored from a global perspective, and a comprehensive study of issues in smart contract security is urgently needed. To this end, we conduct a literature review of smart contract security from a software lifecycle perspective. We first analyze the key features of blockchain that can cause security issues in smart contracts and then summarize the common security vulnerabilities of smart contracts. To address these vulnerabilities, we examine recent advances in smart contract security spanning four development phases: 1) security design; 2) security implementation; 3) testing before deployment; and 4) monitoring and analysis. Finally, we outline emerging challenges and opportunities in smart contract security for blockchain engineers and researchers.</td>

SlithIR uses Static Single Assignment (SSA) form and a reduced instruction set to ease implementation of analyses while preserving semantic information that would be lost in transforming Solidity to bytecode. Slither allows for the application of commonly used program analysis techniques like dataflow and taint tracking. Our framework has four main use cases: (1) automated detection of vulnerabilities, (2) automated detection of code optimization opportunities, (3) improvement of the user's understanding of the contracts, and (4) assistance with code review. In this paper, we present an overview of Slither, detail the design of its intermediate representation, and evaluate its capabilities on real-world contracts. We show that Slither's bug detection is fast, accurate, and outperforms other static analysis tools at finding issues in Ethereum smart contracts in terms of speed, robustness, and balance of detection and false positives. We compared tools using a large dataset of smart contracts and manually reviewed results for 1000 of the most used contracts.</td>

The main goal of MFA is to set up extra layer of safeguard while seeking access to a targets such as physical location, computing device, network or database. MFA security scheme requires more than one method for the validation from commutative family of credentials to verify the user for a transaction. MFA can reduce the risk of using single level password authentication by introducing additional factors of authentication. MFA can prevent hackers from gaining access to a particular account even if the password is compromised. The superfluous layer of security introduced by MFA offers additional security to a user. MFA is implemented by using time-based onetime password (TOTP) technique. For logging to any entity with MFA enabled, the user first needs username and password, as a second factor, the user then needs the MFA token to virtually generate a TOTP.

One of the key challenges in IoT systems is providing security for distributed, networked IoT components that are implemented with potentially very low-end embedded processing systems. As the value of sensor data and actuator access increases in IoT deployments, attackers may increasingly target these vulnerable systems and protocol implementations running on them. For protocols that involve economic transactions on blockchains, as we show in our work, there is a direct monetary value associated with successful attacks. To address this problem, we present a hardware monitoring system that augments processors with logic that tracks the correct execution of software on the embedded systems. Attacks on the system, such as buffer overflow attacks, are recognized and stopped by the hardware monitor. Therefore, the system can avoid economic loss due to an attack and ensure that the protocol implementation is secured. We show the effectiveness of our system on a prototype that uses Linux running on a soft-core LEON3 processor on an Intel Stratix IV FPGA and interacts with the Ethereum blockchain.</td>

      <td>The blockchain technology has achieved tremendous success in open (permissionless) decentralized consensus by employing Proof of Work (PoW) or its variants, whereby unauthorized nodes cannot gain a disproportionate impact on consensus beyond their computational power. However, PoW-based systems incur a high delay and low throughput, making them ineffective in dealing with the real-time Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. On the other hand, the Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms with better delay and throughput performance cannot be employed in permissionless settings due to vulnerability to Sybil attacks. In this article, we present a Sybil-proof wireless network coordinate-based Byzantine consensus (SENATE), which has the merits of both real-time consensus reaching and Sybil-proof, i.e., it is based on the conventional BFT consensus framework yet works in open systems of wireless devices where faulty nodes may launch Sybil attacks. As in a Senate, in the legislature, where the quota of senators per state (district) is a constant irrespective with the population of the state, “senators” in SENATE are selected from participating distributed nodes based on their wireless network coordinates (WNCs) with a fixed number of nodes per district in the WNC space. Elected senators then participate in the subsequent consensus reaching process and broadcast the result. Thereby, the SENATE is a proof against Sybil attacks since pseudonyms of a faulty node are likely to be adjacent in the WNC space and hence fail to be elected. The simulation results reveal that the SENATE can achieve real-time consensus (consensus delay under one second) in a network of hundreds of nodes.</td>

      <td>Degenerate Fault Attacks on Elliptic Curve Parameters in OpenSSL</td>
      <td>In this paper, we describe several practically exploitable fault attacks against OpenSSL's implementation of elliptic curve cryptography, related to the singular curve point decompression attacks of Blömer and Günther (FDTC2015) and the degenerate curve attacks of Neves and Tibouchi (PKC 2016). In particular, we show that OpenSSL allows to construct EC key files containing explicit curve parameters with a compressed base point. A simple single fault injection upon loading such a file yields a full key recovery attack when the key file is used for signing with ECDSA, and a complete recovery of the plaintext when the file is used for encryption using an algorithm like ECIES. The attack is especially devastating against curves with j-invariant equal to 0 such as the Bitcoin curve secp256k1, for which key recovery reduces to a single division in the base field. Additionally, we apply the present fault attack technique to OpenSSL's implementation of ECDH, by combining it with Neves and Tibouchi's degenerate curve attack. This version of the attack applies to usual named curve parameters with nonzero j-invariant, such as P192 and P256. Although it is typically more computationally expensive than the one against signatures and encryption, and requires multiple faulty outputs from the server, it can recover the entire static secret key of the server even in the presence of point validation. These various attacks can be mounted with only a single instruction skipping fault, and therefore can be easily injected using low-cost voltage glitches on embedded devices. We validated them in practice using concrete fault injection experiments on a Rapsberry Pi single board computer running the up to date OpenSSL command line tools-a setting where the threat of fault attacks is quite significant.</td>

An impromptu solution to this protracted issue will not be enough to solve on the long run, thus dedicated researchers have been putting efforts to their best for finding the real problem by asking the right questions. Through this paper authors have attempted to trace the current issues in handling decentralised ledger system using blockchain technology and discussed state of the art management in auditing hardware obfuscation techniques.</td>

      <td>Distributed Ledger Technology for Securing IoT</td>
      <td>Computing and communication are getting increasingly ubiquitous with the inclusion of sophisticated devices like electric vehicles, smart phones and other house hold appliances. Due to the constant evolution in Internet of Things (IoT), the process of collaboration of these devices at a mass scale in order to provide improved and better services to the society. Traditional mechanisms which are used to sustain privacy and security become incapable from achieving the same for IoT systems having distributed or decentralized topology. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT), an emerging digital technology, consists of different kinds of decentralized data structures to ensure immutability by linking blocks using cryptographic measures. DLT has the ability to ensure privacy, security and distributed or decentralized computations with adhering to the constraints of IoT nodes. This study is motivated due to the lack of an in-depth analysis on how the characteristics of DLT can be exploited to secure IoT systems. So, an in depth overview of DLT along with some of the existing solutions to meet security requirements of IoT systems employing DLT have been provided in this paper. With respect to integrating DLT with IoT, this article also highlights the different challenges.</td>

      <td>A Permissioned Distributed Ledger for the US Beef Cattle Supply Chain</td>
      <td>Distributed ledgers using blockchain have gained traction in the supply chain industry due to their unique features of immutability and transparency. They have given people the abilities to solve business problems which were impossible using traditional systems. The US beef cattle industry lacks adequate traceability as most of the farm owners consider such data confidential; possibly harming their businesses if exposed. This article attempts to solve this problem by proposing a smart contract-based supply chain framework using a permissioned blockchain network. This system supports anonymity for the users to protect identities and lets every user store their data locally, while ensuring that the changes are recorded in the chain with cryptographic proofs (hashes). The proposed framework also has methods for the users to perform business transactions and transfer animal-related data to new owners as required. In addition to that, smart contracts have been added to conduct anonymous surveys for data aggregation. The technical contribution of this article is in the system design on how users, data, and communications are handled to maintain data ownership and user privacy while ensuring immutability and confidentiality at different levels of data aggregation. This article also contains an evaluation of the system using integration tests where the outcomes meet the expected design requirements. The framework can be applied to the US beef cattle industry as well as other supply chains with minimal modifications.</td>

According to known vulnerabilities of different consensus algorithms, censorship attacks can always achieve great benefits at low costs by various means. In this paper, we propose improvements to existing POS and POW algorithms to resolve censorship attacks in two methods. The first method improves the Tendermint consensus mechanism by introducing three new types of messages and an auxiliary role of network nodes. The method can automatically defend against censorship attacks and organize an honest chain. The second method is based on the CasperFFG consensus mechanism and can accurately identify the attackers by evaluating the suspicious scores of all validators. However, an honest validator has to manually choose the honest chain. Theoretical analyses show their effectiveness.</td>

      <td>Security Smells in Smart Contracts</td>
      <td>The popularity of blockchain technology encourages organizations to use more blockchain features in mission-critical processes such as trading, access control, and computational public safety. Automation of processes with smart contracts is one of these features that significantly enlarge the scope of a blockchain implementation. Smart contracts help automate business processes by modeling business activities on the distributed ledger. Smart contracts are significantly different from other programs from a defect fixing and security issue handling perspective. The opportunity of fixing such issues is only available in the narrow window before registering the contract on to the blockchain. After a smart contract becomes a part of the chain, it is not possible to update or fix any issues. This distinct nature of smart contracts makes it essential to detect the program issues early on by paying attention to security smells. Security smells are clues that point to a deeper problem in the programming space. In this study, we review the literature and identify vulnerabilities that programmers and beneficiaries of smart contracts must avoid. We explain these security smells and categorize them based on their nature. We also review the applications that detect these vulnerabilities and provide information about their approach and coverage. Our main contribution is the evaluation of smart contracts as a platform or aid for mission-critical applications such as access control platforms. We conducted this evaluation by identifying the issues related to smart contracts and informing the reader about the problem, challenges, and techniques. We conclude by defining future directions for our research.</td>

      <td>Formal Verification of BNB Smart Contract</td>
      <td>Blockchain is a decentralized cryptocurrency framework which has gained considerable attention in research and many industries. Ethereum is an implementation based on blockchain technology. Ethereum blockchain offers smart contracts, a piece of program codes which can execute and record the transactions in blockchain. Users can use smart contracts to create their own tokens based on ERC-20 standard, and token smart contracts have been used to manage and transfer tokens, carrying millions dollars worth of virtual currencies. However, keeping token smart contracts secure can be difficult. When smart contracts are deployed on Ethereum successfully, they cannot be changed. Due to the openness of Ethereum, both users and attackers can invoke contracts. So errors in smart contracts have led and will lead to a loss. For example, the DAO bug led to a 60 million US dollar loss in June 2016. Therefore, the researches on security of smart contracts are urgently important. In this paper, we use a formal approach to verify smart contracts. We apply formal verification on a concrete smart contract example, BNB contract, which is one of the most popular token contracts. We analyze the contract and discover the two attributes in the contract, one is transfer attribute involving the functions of transferring tokens operations, and the other is owner attribute which involves the authority of contract owner. We verify these two attributes respectively. We model the contract using SAPIC, the applied pi calculus and then verify by Tamarin prover. We specify the processes of modeling and verifying. The results show we cannot find an attack path. The research method reduces the complexity of verifying smart contracts and can be used to analyze complex contracts.</td>

      <td>Blockchain was originally developed to support decentralized cryptocurrency applications within a single network. However, the proliferation of blockchain technology has led to the need of supporting transactions across multiple networks requiring interoperability. Thus far, minimal analysis has been dedicated to the interoperability scenario and in particular the prevention of double-spending attacks across interoperable blockchain networks. In this paper, we propose the use of neutral observers to monitor transactions that span multiple blockchains and design a protocol that obviates the double-spending problem across interoperable blockchain networks. We show that the observers, can detect double spending, while remaining honest to the protocol as it is more profitable to them than colluding due to our proposed disincentivization scheme. Leveraging Ethereum's smart-contract functionality, we simulate our proposed disincentivization scheme and show its cost-effectiveness.</td>

      <td>The realization of spectrum sensing is becoming more and more possible with the development of technologies such as artificial intelligence and software radio. While we are paying attention to its performance, we cannot ignore the security problems it faces. This paper proposes an optimization scheme to defend against spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attacks based on the double threshold energy detection and block chain technology. First, to reduce the impact of noise uncertainty on spectrum sensing results, we assume that the judgment threshold value will be dynamically determined according to the actual SNR of the receiver; Secondly, the block chain is introduced to consider as a spectrum sharing platform, and build the reputation classification mechanism for the cognitive users (CUs). We use a reward and penalty mechanism similar to the bitcoin system for CU's trust value statistics. Only users in the reliable zone can participate in sensing fusion; the rest will be in the waiting or discarding zone. We use MATLAB to carry out simulation experiments on the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve the probability of false alarm to 0.1, the probability of detection to 0.93, and effectively avoid the interference of malicious users.</td>

      <td>Distributed Consensus Algorithm for Events Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems</td>
      <td>In the harsh environmental conditions of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), the consensus problem seems to be one of the central topics that affect the performance of consensus-based applications, such as events detection, estimation, tracking, blockchain, etc. In this paper, we investigate the events detection based on consensus problem of CPS by means of compressed sensing (CS) for applications such as attack detection, industrial process monitoring, automatic alert system, and prediction for potentially dangerous events in CPS. The edge devices in a CPS are able to calculate a log-likelihood ratio (LLR) from local observation for one or more events via a consensus approach to iteratively optimize the consensus LLRs for the whole CPS system. The information-exchange topologies are considered as a collection of jointly connected networks and an iterative distributed consensus algorithm is proposed to optimize the LLRs to form a global optimal decision. Each active device in the CPS first detects the local region and obtains a local LLR, which then exchanges with its active neighbors. Compressed data collection is enforced by a reliable cluster partitioning scheme, which conserves sensing energy and prolongs network lifetime. Then the LLR estimations are improved iteratively until a global optimum is reached. The proposed distributed consensus algorithm can converge fast and hence improve the reliability with lower transmission burden and computation costs in CPS. Simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</td>

      <td>AbstractIn contemporary era of technologies, blockchain has acquired tremendous attention from various domains. It has wide spectrum of applications ranging from finance to social services and has greatly influenced the emerging business world. Since, blockchain technology is getting embedded in the e-commerce services, the cryptocurrencies are gaining huge prevalence. Bitcoin and ethereum are few such crypto currencies, which have utilized decentralized nature of blockchain. Blockchain can be considered as a distributed database system containing immutable ledgers, which are prone to attack by malicious users. Although, from the initial digital currency to the present smart contract, the utilities of blockchain have been harnessed, the innovative technology has to rely on cryptography for its security. There are several reports, which emphases on the vulnerabilities and security of blockchain, however, there is a lack of a comprehensive and methodical survey in both application and technical views. In this survey article, the authors cover various aspects related to blockchain including its taxonomies and the situations in which a particular category of blockchain should be applied. The authors also focusses on the structure of blockchain and the working of the ongoing transactions in the cryptocurrency network. In addition, the authors also specify various categories of consensus protocols, smart contracts, forks, techniques for generating the consensus. A detailed taxonomy of blockchain along with their features and related real-world applications is also discussed. In addition, existing key platforms of blockchain related to the cryptocurrencies, hyperledger and multichain are also discussed. Existing emerging vulnerabilities of blockchain related to the recent attacks on bitcoin and etherum is also presented along with the defensive methodologies and future trends in blockchain.</td>

Blockchain applications in the healthcare sector generally require more stringent authentication, interoperability, and record sharing requirements, due to exacting legal requirements, such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Building on existing blockchain technologies, researchers in both academia and industry have started to explore applications that are geared toward healthcare use. These applications include smart contracts, fraud detection, and identity verification. Even with these improvements, there are still concerns as blockchain technology has its own specific vulnerabilities and issues that need to be addressed, such as mining incentives, mining attacks, and key management. Additionally, many of the healthcare applications have unique requirements that are not addressed by many of the blockchain experiments being explored, as highlighted in this survey paper.

      <td>AbstractAudit logs serve as a critical component in enterprise business systems and are used for auditing, storing, and tracking changes made to the data. However, audit logs are vulnerable to a series of attacks enabling adversaries to tamper data and corresponding audit logs without getting detected. Among them, two well-known attacks are “the physical access attack,” which exploits root privileges, and “the remote vulnerability attack,” which compromises known vulnerabilities in database systems. In this paper, we present BlockAudit: a scalable and tamper-proof system that leverages the design properties of audit logs and security guarantees of blockchain to enable secure and trustworthy audit logs. Towards that, we construct the design schema of BlockAudit and outline its functional and operational procedures. We implement our design on a custom-built Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) blockchain system and evaluate the performance in terms of latency, network size, payload size, and transaction rate. Our results show that conventional audit logs can seamlessly transition into BlockAudit to achieve higher security and defend against the known attacks on audit logs.</td>

      <td>FSFC: An input filter-based secure framework for smart contract</td>
      <td>AbstractDiscovering vulnerabilities in smart contracts, particularly those that can be exploited, is challenging. Existing research efforts tend to focus on pre-tests or are not capable of dynamically protecting the deployed contracts without impacting on the availability of the contracts. Thus in this paper, we propose and implement a high-availability and unified input Filter-based Secure Framework for Ethereum smart Contract (hereafter referred to as FSFC). FSFC is designed to allow the deployed smart contracts to continue running normally even when faced with potential attacks (due to vulnerability exploitation). Specifically, the proposed approach allows one to dynamically identify and discard bad inputs before getting processed. In other words, the owner can protect the contract by deploying filters through FSFC, regardless of the vulnerability discovered in the deployed contract, and without suspending the contract service. We also evaluate the security of FSFC. Then, using integer vulnerability as a case study, we demonstrate how FSFC can be deployed and evaluate its utility using real-world smart contracts with known integer vulnerability. For example, a comparative summary demonstrates that in comparison to the plain Geth, FSFC only incurs minimal additional overhead for the miners and less than 2% extra gas consumption for normal users.</td>

This paper identifies users’ perceptual differences in terms of usability and security. Two versions of user survey are used to collect data, which reveal significant differences in users’ perceptions of credit/debit cards and Bitcoin. The usability attributes of both systems examined show that respondents perceive the usability of credit/debit cards to be higher than Bitcoin. This has a great negative influence on users’ security perceptions of Bitcoin. We conclude that Bitcoin, as a crypto-currency, is still in its infancy and requires user education and a new way of thinking. The study recommends developing users’ mental models to deepen developers’ understanding of anonymous digital payment technology and improve user-centred design. We also make recommendations with respect to e-government services that may be developed relying on crypto-currencies.</td>

Prominent among these concerns are issues around governance and control in distributed ledgers: How are distributed ledger technologies governed? Can blockchains address complex administration problems? What key issues of note for practitioners and academics have emerged thus far? In this paper we aim to review the existing governance practices of established or popular blockchain and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) systems with a view to understanding how they hold up in times of crises. What questions are raised when they are compromised or faced consensus challenges in coordinating action especially around control and accountability? We use a translational process, generating focal insights about present concerns from the reference point of completed academic studies and extensive practitioner consultation. Rather than adopting a declarative approach attempting to provide all the answers, we draw insights from the IT platform governance literature to offer a critical perspective for asking the right questions around key governance issues in financial infrastructure such as decision rights, control mechanisms, and incentives.</td>

To demonstrate this security threat, two Bitcoin wallet software are studied, namely: Multibit HD and Electrum. Each wallet is subject to a combination of a password exploits and a restore wallet exploit. Findings suggest that it is possible to gain access to Multibit HD and Electrum wallets through offline brute force password attempts. Once a password is found, it is possible to restore a wallet with all Bitcoins contained within. This restoration is possible even if access to the Bitcoin wallet has never occurred.

Debates about which one will prevail as the best practice are currently a very popular topic. Security, and more specifically resiliency to evolving cyber threats, will likely be the main point of concern.

      <td>Blockchain Security Hole: Issues and Solutions</td>
      <td>Blockchain technology is widely known because it is the underlying technology used by the bitcoin. It became more popular because it also can be used as backbone for various applications in finance, media, security and others. One of the main concerns for this technology is how secure the information that the users distributed over the network. This paper studies and highlights the important security issues concerned and discusses the solutions that proposed by the researchers and theoretical solution proposed to address some of the issues. However, this approach needs to be investigated further if it is to be implemented later in the near future. This paper can give direction for future researchers who are interested of this area.</td>

      <td>Traditionally, security and economics functionalities in IT financial services and protocols (FinTech) have been perceived as separate objectives. We argue that keeping them separate is a bad idea for FinTech “Decentralized Autonomous Organizations” (DAOs). In fact, security and economics are one for DAOs: we show that the failure of a security property, e.g. anonymity, can destroy a DAOs because economic attacks can be tailgated to security attacks. This is illustrated by the examples of “TheDAO” (built on the Ethereum platform) and the DAOed version of a Futures Exchange. We claim that security and economics vulnerabilities, which we named seconomics vulnerabilities, are indeed new “beasts” to be reckoned with.</td>

This technology has opened the door to the development of Ethereum, a blockchain platform with smart contracts that can hold and automatically transfer tokens.

In this paper, we classify attack vectors of Ethereum smart contracts, then propose some behaviour-based methods to detect them.

The increasing number of security events regarding smart contracts have led to huge pecuniary losses and destroyed the ecological stability of contract layer on the blockchain. Faced with the increasing quantity of contracts, it is an emerging issue to effectively and efficiently detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Existing methods of detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts like Oyente mainly employ symbolic execution. This method is very time-consuming, as the symbolic execution requires the exploration of all executable paths in a contract. In this work, we propose an efficient model for the detection of vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts with machine learning techniques. The model is able to effectively and fast detect vulnerabilities based on the patterns learned from training samples. Our model is evaluated on 49502 real-world smart contracts and the results verify its effectiveness and efficiency.</td>

This paper improves upon the result by showing that if appropriate inconsistency tolerance is allowed the blockchain can withstand even more powerful external attacks in the honest miner setting.

      <td>Leveraging Bitcoin Testnet for Bidirectional Botnet Command and Control Systems</td>
      <td>Over the past twenty years, the number of devices connected to the Internet grew exponentially. Botnets benefited from this rise to increase their size and the magnitude of their attacks. However, they still have a weak point in their Command &amp; Control (C&amp;C) system, which is often based on centralized services or require a complex infrastructure to keep operating without being taken down by authorities. The recent spread of blockchain technologies may give botnets a powerful tool to make them very hard to disrupt. Recent research showed how it is possible to embed C&amp;C messages in Bitcoin transactions, making them nearly impossible to block. Nevertheless, transactions have a cost and allow very limited amounts of data to be transmitted. Because of that, only messages from the botmaster to the bots are sent via Bitcoin, while bots are assumed to communicate through external channels. Furthermore, for the same reason, Bitcoin-based messages are sent in clear. In this paper we show how, using Bitcoin Testnet, it is possible to overcome these limitations and implement a cost-free, bidirectional, and encrypted C&amp;C channel between the botmaster and the bots. We propose a communication protocol and analyze its viability in real life. Our results show that this approach would enable a botmaster to build a robust and hard-to-disrupt C&amp;C system at virtually no cost, thus representing a realistic threat for which countermeasures should be devised.</td>

      <td>Nowadays digital transaction security is seen as essential in an online payment system. Earlier, cryptographic authentication techniques were used to make transactions very secure with third-party verification. However, in recent times, digital transactions have developed to allow online payments to be made directly from one party to another, without the intervention of the third party. This kind of P2P network transaction is achieved by utilizing the blockchain innovation. A blockchain uses the idea of Bitcoin. It isn’t observed by the central authority, but its clients direct and approve exchanges when one individual pays another for merchandise or administrations, dispensing with the requirement for outside confirmation. All finished exchanges are freely recorded as a block and each block is added one after other to form as a blockchain. In this paper, we present the workflow of a digital online payment system using the blockchain technique. We explain the secure sign-in procedure of the blockchain strategy. We elaborate on the effects of blockchain technology on the online transaction management system in terms of security and usability.</td>

The widespread attention for blockchains has led to manifold research and development activities. As a result, today’s blockchain landscape is heavily fragmented, with different, incompatible technologies being available to potential users.

Second, we design a new structure for the blocks in the Bitcoin network, which provides a way to store the IP addresses in the blocks. Third, we present a novel network protocol named dynamic network configuration for public blockchain. Our protocol pushes the updating of IP addresses in the blocks and changes the construction of the network periodically. From theoretical analysis and simulated evaluation, we find that under our protocol, the Bitcoin network can defend against the selfish mining, the eclipse attack and the information delaying attack effectively.</td>

      <td>Bitcoin is the first and seemingly the most successful cryptocurrency based in a peer-to-peer network that uses blockchain technology. Given Bitcoin’s growing real-life deployment and popularity, its security has aroused more and more attention in both financial and information industries. As a body containing a variety of cryptosystems, Bitcoin may also suffer from cryptanalysis attacks. This paper focuses on one of such attacks: the Trojan message attack, and presents in detail how to conduct the attack according to the structure and workflow of the Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash protocol of Bitcoin. The attack aims at forging an upcoming transaction record and results from the fact that all users’ candidate input transactions are open to the attacker. The construction of the attack employs a combination of the Bitcoin transaction structure with standard Merkle–Damgard extension vulnerabilities. The conclusion of the attack shows that both the mathematical structure of the hash function itself and the public information in the blockchain are important to the security of Bitcoin. These factors should be considered in the future for the design of other cryptocurrency and blockchain systems.</td>

      <td>Supported by the current hype on Bitcoin, the number of available cryptocurrencies has steadily increased over the past years. Currently, relevant portals list more than 1.500 cryptocurrencies. Many of them slightly deviate from approved and tested technical concepts and realize security-related functionality in different ways. While the security of major cryptocurrencies has already been studied in more detail, security properties of less popular cryptocurrencies that deviate from approved technical concepts often remain unclear. This is a problem, as users run the risk of losing invested money in case the respective cryptocurrency is unable to provide sufficient security. In this paper, we underpin this statement by means of a detailed analysis of the cryptocurrency FirstCoin. We identify and discuss vulnerabilities of FirstCoin, which lead to a low network hash rate and allow for 51% attacks. We propose a double-spending attack that exploits these vulnerabilities and demonstrate the proposed attack’s feasibility by running it in an isolated evaluation environment. This way, we show FirstCoin to be insecure and provide a real-world example that underpins the general problem of cryptocurrencies deviating from approved security concepts and relying on weak security designs.</td>

      <td>The development of blockchain technology is developing rapidly. From the appearance of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other blockchain systems to the Hyperledger and EOS platforms, the core concerns of the development of these systems is the performance. Bitcoin, Ethereum and other blockchain systems have been criticized a lot due to their lower TPS. Subsequent system platforms such as Hyperledger and EOS have upgraded TPS performance to thousands or even more. In addition, such a lot of blockchain projects claimed to have thousands to millions of throughput performance. It is difficult for market participants to verify whether the performance of such a system is in line with what they claimed, which raises concerns about the overall security of the blockchain system. At the same time, many projects ignore other indicators to pursuit only higher TPS performance, and cause the “Only Throughput” slogan. This paper proposes an application system performance test scheme for blockchain technology, gives an indicator system for performance testing and verification, explains the testing principles and methods of these indicators, and designs the framework and components of the test tools. This scheme can test whether the performance of the blockchain system meets the actual business needs, verify and evaluate the system from a technical point of view, then promote the real blockchain project.</td>

      <td>Offline channels can improve the scalability of blockchains by reducing the number of transactions in the blockchain. Offline channels provide Path-Based fund Transfer (PBT) service which allows a pair of peers without a mutual channel to transfer fund between them using paths in the channel network. In PBTs, peers allow a 3rd party to use their channel for fund transfer in exchange for a transfer fee. There are channels in the Bitcoin Lightning network which are designed to collect such PBT transfer fees. An analysis of Bitcoin’s Lightning network revealed the existence of hubs or nodes with very high degree in the channel network. There are only 10 nodes who own more than 50% funds in the Lightning network. These nodes are designed to facilitate PBTs among peers with a low degree (number of channels) in exchange for transfer fees. The emergence of hubs in channel network created the possibility of collusion attack on the channel network where a group of hubs deliberately make few channels non-operational to prevent PBTs involving a selected set of hubs (victims of the collusion attack). In this paper, we model such collusion attack using cooperative game theory and using Banzhaf index we classify the vulnerability of the hubs from the collusion attacks. We propose a design principle of the channel network that can decrease the possibility of collusion attacks.</td>

A sequence of transaction metadata forms a subchain of the Bitcoin blockchain, and it can be used to store a tamper-proof execution trace of a smart contract. Except for the trivial case of contracts which admit any trace, in general there may exist inconsistent subchains which represent incorrect contract executions. A crucial issue is how to make it difficult, for an adversary, to subvert the execution of a contract by making its subchain inconsistent. Existing approaches either postulate that subchains are always consistent, or give weak guarantees about their security (for instance, they are susceptible to Sybil attacks). We propose a consensus protocol, based on Proof-of-Stake, that incentivizes nodes to consistently extend the subchain. We empirically evaluate the security of our protocol, and we show how to exploit it as the basis for smart contracts on Bitcoin.</td>

This realization leads to the birth of more than 2300 cryptocurrencies in the last decade. Despite this evolvement, the Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are facing many challenges right now. Facebook’s Libra is a new kind of cryptocurrency built on the foundation of blockchain technology conceived by Libra Association - twenty-eight high-profile governing members that will work together to create a more inclusive financial system using consortium blockchain technology. The goal of the Libra is to serve as a solid foundation for a highly scalable, frictionless, and traceable global financial systems with extremely high transactions rate. However, the proposed Libra cryptocurrency has yet to face many issues. In this paper, we critically analyzed the status of the Libra, its underlying concept, and the challenges faced by it once launched as a global decentralized financial system. Currently, the proposed Libra is very ambiguous with uncertain goals and intentions. In particular, we explored the placement technology of Libra, which is not very much well define in comparison with Bitcoin and other public blockchains which are fully decentralized, transparent, borderless and fully open for transparency. Also, we explore the security and privacy features of Libra concerning around three-billion user base of Facebook social media ecosystem (i.e., Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook).</td>

      <td>Several applications require robust and tamper-proof logging systems, e.g. electronic voting or bank information systems. At Scytl we use a technology, called immutable logs, that we deploy in our electronic voting solutions. This technology ensures the integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation of the generated logs, thus in case of any event the auditors can use them to investigate the issue. As a security recommendation it is advisable to store and/or replicate the information logged in a location where the logger has no writing or modification permissions. Otherwise, if the logger gets compromised, the data previously generated could be truncated or altered using the same private keys. This approach is costly and does not protect against collusion between the logger and the entities that hold the replicated data. In order to tackle these issues, in this article we present a proposal and implementation to immutabilize integrity proofs of the secure logs within the Bitcoin’s blockchain. Due to the properties of the proposal, the integrity of the immutabilized logs is guaranteed without performing log data replication and even in case the logger gets latterly compromised.</td>

The first strategy is damaging for substantial hashrates, and we show that the second strategy is even worse. This confirms what we already proved for Bitcoin: Selfish mining is most of all an attack on the difficulty adjustment formula. We show that the current reward for signaling uncle blocks is a weak incentive for the attacker to signal blocks. We compute the profitabilities of different strategies and find out that for a large parameter space values, strategies that do not signal blocks are the best ones. We compute closed-form formulas for the apparent hashrates for these strategies and compare them. We use a direct combinatorial analysis with Dyck words to find these closed-form formulas.</td>

      <td>Bitcoin is the first successful implementation of the blockchain, which eliminates the role of trusted centralized settlement entities. Although Bitcoin was designed with anonymity in mind, it has recently faced privacy challenges as some users’ identities have been revealed (Biryukov and Khovratovich 2014; Fleder et al. 2015; Maesa et al. 2016, 2017) To address this issue, mixing services are used in Bitcoin to increase user anonymity. Mixcoin provides a centralized mixing service that reduces the impact of blockchain transaction analysis by hiding the links among transaction addresses to preserve users’ anonymity. However, Mixcoin has shortcomings against active attacks in which the attacker can compromise mixing service and inject fraudulent transaction addresses to steal funds. Mixcoin has an integrity issue in that the mixing service enabled dishonest behavior. This paper proposes T-Mix, a protocol that addresses Mixcoin’s shortcomings by enhancing its availability and integrity using threshold cryptography. We present Mixcoin’s threat model followed by a description of T-Mix.</td>

However, it has been shown that this protocol is not incentive compatible, because the selfish mining strategy enables a miner to gain unfair rewards. Existing defenses either demand fundamental changes to block validity rules or have little effect against a resourceful attacker. This paper proposes a backward-compatible defense mechanism which outperforms the previous best defense. Our fork-resolving policy neglects blocks that are not published in time and appreciates blocks that incorporate links to competing blocks of their predecessors. Consequently, a block that is kept secret until a competing block is published contributes to neither or both branches, hence it confers no advantage in winning the block race. Additionally, we discuss the dilemma between partition recovery time and selfish mining resistance, and how to balance them in our defense.</td>

      <td>A New Approach to Prevent Reentrant Attack in Solidity Smart Contracts</td>
      <td>\nCurrently, Solidity is a high-level language for smart contracts that need to run on Ethereum virtual machines, it is being promoted with the widespread use of Ethereum. However, the Solidity has a feature of fallback function, makes it easier for attackers to use fallback function to launch reentrant attack, which may cause huge economic losses about the user. Therefore, a new method based on Solidity and Condition-Orientated programming is proposed to prevent reentrant attack. This method separates conditional branches and major logical state changes, encapsulates the separated conditional branches into multiple modifiers and defines a global state variable, packages the state of the state variable in the modifier, and finally uses the modifier as a precondition for the transfer function in the smart contract. When an attacker reenters the transfer function in the smart contract, the reentrant attack can be prevented by controlling state variable. The experimental results show that this method not only makes the logic of the contract code more reasonable, but also effective.\n</td>

The state-of-the-art works mainly study the relationship between the propagation time and blockchain security at the systematic level, neglecting the fine-grained impact of peering nodes in blockchain networks. To conduct a node-level synchronization analysis, we take advantage of the large deviation theory and game theory to study the pull-based propagation from a microscopic perspective. We examine the blockchain synchronization in a bidirectional manner via investigating the impact of full nodes as responders and that of partial nodes as requesters. Based on that, we further reveal the most efficient path to speed up synchronization from full nodes and design the best synchronization request scheme based on the concept of correlated equilibrium for partial nodes.

      <td>Massive Spatio-temporal data is increasingly collected in a variety of domains including supply chain. The authenticity as well as the security of such data is usually a concern due to the requirement of trust in centralised systems. Blockchain technology has come to the forth recently and offers ways for trustless and reliable storage and processing of data. However, current blockchain proposals either do not support spatial data or make simplifying assumptions such as ‘trusted’ servers to process spatio-temporal data. We presume that the notion of ‘trust’ in a blockchain is too strong an assumption and propose a robust spatio-temporal verification protocol for the blockchain. In this work, we present a novel practical proof-of-location protocol on top of a permissioned blockchain. The protocol is instrumented by the implementation of an access control model and utilises a set of verification rules to create and verify spatio-temporal data points. We also propose a threat-to-validity model to evaluate the robustness of the verification protocol. The applicability and practicality of the protocol is demonstrated by the implementation of a supply chain case study as a proof-of-concept.</td>

However, as there is an increase in value of bitcoin followed by Cyprus financial crisis in past March, issues regarding the security breach on the rise. Since the exchange between legal tender and virtual currency is free in case of bitcoin, direct damage caused by security breach is very large.

If a light node wants to verify a transaction, it has to spend nearly one week to download the data of whole chain with download rate of 1 MB/s, which seriously hinders the usage of blockchain. In order to resolve this problem, checkpoint is used to reduce the capacity of data, but this centralized scheme obviously violates the decentralization of blockchain. Other schemes are proposed will change the structure of blockchain may suffer the risk that adversary can fork a blockchain to cheat the light nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain architecture, which simplifies the verification in blockchain and is compatible with most consensus mechanism.

      <td>A Security Detection Model for Selfish Mining Attack</td>
      <td>\nAs a new technology, the “decentralization” of blockchain has been paid more and more attention. With the increasingly wide range of applications of blockchain technology, its security has become a bottleneck restricting the development. In order to solve the problem, the blockchain structure characteristic can be used to build a security detection model. Taking 51% attack detection as an example, the relationship among attack state, attack intensity and attack time was analyzed. However, because of the variety of blockchain attacks, the test of only one attack cannot verify the effectiveness of the detection model. On the basis of the existing work, this paper studies the security of selfish mining attack under the existing detection model and compares it with 51% attack, and finds that the attack block and honest block are related to the ability of the attacker. When the attacker’s ability exceeds half of the total ability, the attack block is more than the honest block. However, for the number of system states, there is a big difference between 51% attack and selfish mining attack. Specifically, in selfish mining attack, when the attacker’s ability exceeds 25%, the number of states tends to stabilize. While in 51% attack, the attacker’s ability needs to exceed 50% in order to stabilize. This shows that the detection model can well distinguish 51% attack and selfish mining attack. According to this characteristic, we can further construct an effective alarm mechanism.</td>

      <td>BIT Problem: Is There a Trade-off in the Performances of Blockchain Systems?</td>
      <td>Blockchain technology, as a revolutionary concept, born with Bitcoin, is triggering the start of a new era on information. It is generally recognized that the blockchain-based systems achieve high security in the process of information sharing in a distributed network, at the cost of low efficiency in terms of data throughput or high costs in consuming computational resources. A natural question we are interested in is whether there exists a trade-off principle between different performances of a blockchain system, which is also regarded as blockchain impossibility triangle (BIT) problem. In this paper, we propose an analysis method which can be used to verify the existence of the BIT. Our analysis method is composed of two layers. In the first layer the basic and core attributes are abstracted by building a consensus model, and in the second layer the analysis approach is designed to verify the existence of a BIT. Specifically, in the first layer, we firstly define a leaderless consensus model to quantitatively abstract the basic parameters in the process of system consensus, then three core attributes are justified to serve as the three vertices of the discussed triangle problem, namely security, cost, and efficiency. Based on the core attributes, we propose the credibility metric which measures the difficulty of achieving credible consensus for a given blockchain system. In the second layer, we analyze the existence of BIT, where we have demonstrated the conditions that a BIT exists and the conditions that the triangle does not exist. Finally, the proposed analysis method is applied in analyzing PoW based blockchain systems, where we have shown that there is no BIT problem in PoW based systems. Furthermore, the proposed analysis method can also help the blockchain developers in finding the promising directions of a new blockchain consensus mechanism.</td>

      <td>Updatable Blockchains</td>
      <td>Software updates for blockchain systems become a real challenge when they impact the underlying consensus mechanism. The activation of such changes might jeopardize the integrity of the blockchain by resulting in chain splits. Moreover, the software update process should be handed over to the community and this means that the blockchain should support updates without relying on a trusted party. In this paper, we introduce the notion of updatable blockchains and show how to construct blockchains that satisfy this definition. Informally, an updatable blockchain is a secure blockchain and in addition it allows to update its protocol preserving the history of the chain. In this work, we focus only on the processes that allow securely switching from one blockchain protocol to another assuming that the blockchain protocols are correct. That is, we do not aim at providing a mechanism that allows reaching consensus on what is the code of the new blockchain protocol. We just assume that such a mechanism exists (like the one proposed in NDSS 2019 by Zhang et al.), and show how to securely go from the old protocol to the new one. The contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows. We provide the first formal definition of updatable ledgers and propose the description of two compilers. These compilers take a blockchain and turn it into an updatable blockchain. The first compiler requires the structure of the current and the updated blockchain to be very similar (only the structure of the blocks can be different) but it allows for an update process more simple, efficient. The second compiler that we propose is very generic (i.e., makes few assumptions on the similarities between the structure of the current blockchain and the update blockchain). The drawback of this compiler is that it requires the new blockchain to be resilient against a specific adversarial behaviour and requires all the honest parties to be online during the update process. However, we show how to get rid of the latest requirement (the honest parties being online during the update) in the case of proof-of-work and proof-of-stake ledgers.</td>

      <td>Zerocoin proposed adding decentralized cryptographically anonymous e-cash to Bitcoin. Given the increasing popularity of Bitcoin and its reliance on a distributed pseudononymous public ledger, this anonymity is important if only to provide the same minimal privacy protections from nosy neighbors offered by conventional banking. Unfortunately, at 25 KB, the non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs for spending a zerocoin are nearly prohibitively large. In this paper, we consider several improvements. First, we strengthen Zerocoin’s anonymity guarantees, making them independent of the size of these proofs. Given this freedom, we explore several techniques for drastically reducing proof size while ensuring that forging a single zerocoin is more difficult than the block mining process used to maintain Bitcoin’s distributed ledger. Provided a zerocoin is worth less than the reward for a Bitcoin block, forging a coin is not an economically rational action. Hence we preserve Zerocoin’s absolute anonymity guarantees while achieving drastic reductions in proof size by limiting ourselves to security against rational attackers.</td>

      <td>A Security-Oriented Architecture for Federated Learning in Cloud Environments</td>
      <td>Federate architectures are able to provide a scalable and shared environment for the distributed training and testing of machine learning applications. However, federated learning architectures shows potential security vulnerabilities in particular to the data poisoning attacks, incoming from participants to the federation. In such a scenario, a malicious participant may inject bad data in order to sabotage the result of the training. Such attacks may provide both a downgrade of the general performance of the learned model and may compromise the fairness of the machine learning application. As such applications are growing in criticality, such learning models must face with security and privacy as well as with scalability issues. The aim of the paper is to improve federated models by providing an architecture base on cloud computing which grants these additional features. The paper also discusses technical details, in particular, the usage of blockchain schemes to provide integrity and homomorphic cryptography for guaranteeing privacy.</td>

      <td>Decentralized Access Control Encryption in Public Blockchain</td>
      <td>\nSince its invention, the public blockchain has attracted more attention from both the academia and industry because of its fully decentralization and persistency features. However, the privacy issue in public blockchain is still challengeable. While there exists privacy preservation mechanisms proposed for the public blockchain, almost all of them can only solve partial of the privacy issue, either user privacy or data privacy indeed, in it. In this work, we present a decentralized access control encryption scheme which ensures user and data privacy simultaneously in public blockchain. With our cryptographic solution, the validity of one specific transaction can be publicly verified, while its content can only be retrieved by its intended receivers. Moreover, the origin of this transaction cannot be identified by any participant except the receivers in the network. Our analysis shows that our solution is really suitable to deploy in public blockchain and is proven secure under mathematical assumptions.</td>

      <td>With the continuous advancement of power system reform, grid enterprises relying on new technologies such as big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, internet of things (IoT) and blockchain are transforming towards more open energy internet enterprises, which brings more challenges to network security. The construction of SG-eIoT has promoted the circulation of data in all aspects of the system, cleaning up the barriers of data islands and effectively improving the operational efficiency of power company. However, due to the large scale of data access points, complex business operations, and huge amount of upstream and downstream enterprises in the industry chain, security risks may exist in the information circulation process such as being tampered and untrustworthy. Aiming at the problem of information security and credibility in the distributed network environment of power enterprises, this paper studies the application of blockchain technology in business information flow, and constructs a new data management mode of weak service connection to strong data interoperability based on the characteristics of blockchain technology, such as non-tampering property, collective maintenance and transaction non-repudiation, which achieves accurate data protection, and fully spports the construction of world-class energy internet company with excellent competitiveness.</td>

      <td>Blockchain technology has been widely concerned by scholars and industry since it was put forward, and Banks, Internet of Things, Supply Chain, Government and Medical Industry have proposed using blockchain technology to solve their problems, respectively. However, there are some difficulties in the deployment of blockchain products. One important reason is privacy protection. In order to protect blockchain privacy, discretionary access control method is proposed, and the corresponding model and algorithm are given. Encryption algorithm is used to encrypt the blockchain transaction transactions to privacy transactions. The encryption key and access rights are encapsulated by Lagrange polynomial to form secret information sent to authorized users. Extracting enough secret information, authorized user groups work together to calculate the decryption key, and then obtain the transaction transactions plaintext and finally implement consensus mechanism to verify the transaction. Secret information safely self-destruct immediately if exceed effective time. Authorized users and effective time are entirely determined by the owner of the transaction. This paper realizes key distributed securely, achieves discretionary access control and fine-grained access control and provides strong privacy protection.</td>

      <td>Using Economic Risk to Model Miner Hash Rate Allocation in Cryptocurrencies</td>
      <td>Abrupt changes in the miner hash rate applied to a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain can adversely affect user experience and security. Because different PoW blockchains often share hashing algorithms, miners face a complex choice in deciding how to allocate their hash power among chains. We present an economic model that leverages Modern Portfolio Theory to predict a miner’s allocation over time using price data and inferred risk tolerance. The model matches actual allocations with mean absolute error within 20% for four out of the top five miners active on both Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchains. A model of aggregate allocation across those four miners shows excellent agreement in magnitude with the actual aggregate as well a correlation coefficient of 0.649. The accuracy of the aggregate allocation model is also sufficient to explain major historical changes in inter-block time (IBT) for BCH. Because estimates of miner risk are not time-dependent and our model is otherwise price-driven, we are able to use it to anticipate the effect of a major price shock on hash allocation and IBT in the BCH blockchain. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we show that, despite mitigation by the new difficulty adjustment algorithm, a price drop of 50% could increase the IBT by 50% for at least a day, with a peak delay of 100%.</td>

However, testing is not enough; it is also important to ensure the quality and completeness of the tests. There are already several approaches that tackle this challenge with mutation testing, but their effectiveness is questionable since they only considered small contract samples. Hence, we evaluate the quality of smart contract mutation testing at scale. We choose the most promising of the existing (smart contract specific) mutation operators, analyse their effectiveness in terms of killability and highlight severe vulnerabilities that can be injected with the mutations. Moreover, we improve the existing mutation methods by introducing a novel killing condition that is able to detect a deviation in the gas consumption, i.e., in the monetary value that is required to perform transactions.\n</td>

In order to achieve this, we make use of a blind signature scheme [14, 23] as well as an append-only public log.

      <td>Short Paper: Secure Offline Payments in Bitcoin</td>
      <td>Double-spending attacks on fast payments are one of the fatal architectural problems in Cryptocurrencies. Dmitrienko et al. proposed an offline fast payment scheme that relies on tamper-proof wallets produced by trustworthy manufacturers. With the wallets, the payee can immediately trust the transactions generated by the wallets without waiting for their registration to the blockchain. Secure coin-preloading to the wallet is important, while illegal coin-preloading can cause over/double-spending by the trusted wallets. For this, they proposed an interesting protocol that makes use of a fragment of the main blockchain to prove to the wallets the legitimacy of preloaded coins. One drawback is that, in proving that the fragment are from honest miners, their protocol requires a trusted online time-stamp server so that the wallets can verify the timestamps to see if the blocks in the fragment is mined with sufficiently large amount of computing resources. Otherwise, it sacrifices usability. In order to eliminate such an online trustee, in this paper we took the opposite approach that the payee (not the wallets) verifies the legitimacy of preloaded coins at the time of offline payment. As a consequence, our result shows that, with light-weight tamper-proof wallets, completely decentralized offline payment is possible without any modification to the existing Bitcoin network.</td>

So, proof of stake may be the most promising mining algorithm for cryptocurrency. In proof of work, the validation of a transaction is based on the amount of computational power provided by a miner in the blockchain to solve the cryptographic puzzle but proof of stake is a consensus mining algorithm of blockchain that depends upon the amount of stake deposited by a validator into the network.

      <td>New Game-Theoretic Analysis of DDoS Attacks Against Bitcoin Mining Pools with Defence Cost</td>
      <td>Since almost all new bitcoins nowadays are minted by mining pools, the security of mining pools is quite crucial to the health of the Bitcoin system. Among the attacks targeting at mining pools, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is the notable one. Previous research shows that mining pools would launch DDoS attacks on others when the size is relatively large. However, no mining pools claimed responsibility to any DDoS attacks on mining pools till now. In this paper, we revise the previous game-theoretic analysis model by adding DDoS defense cost. With the assumption that the whole computing resource of any mining pool consists of mining, defense and attack, we obtain some interesting conclusions. (1) If the failure probability of DDoS attack is high, then mining pools would have a greater incentive to stay peacefully. (2) Increasing the computing resource in mining is always the primary choice for mining pools, no matter whether they are launching DDoS attacks or under DDoS attacks.</td>
